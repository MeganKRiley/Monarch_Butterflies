With eggs being reported north of here &amp; much further north of here, and still not finding eggs on our milkweed, we went on an egg hunt today.

It got badly damaged in the hailstorm that came through on the night of March 18th. The stem is bent and twisted so that the crown with its circle of leaves is on the ground, but thankfully the stem did not get severed nor the crown broken off (which is what happened to many of the other milkweed plants). It survived and is now supporting this new life. If you look very closely you can see the larva on a leaf near the crown.

However, this Spring, probably because of the excessive rainfall (e.g., nearly double the normal amount for May) most of these fields did not get mowed until the end of June.  By then they already had lots of healthy milkweeds growing (and probably some eggs and caterpillars), as shown in photo #1.  Unfortunately, all that then got destroyed by the mowing, as shown in photo #2, perhaps losing a good portion of a generation of local Monarchs.  Note in the photo that not only was the field mowed, but so were the plants on the roadside side of the fence.<P>Meanwhile, at home, in the past we've raised several dozen common, swamp, and tuberosa milkweeds in individual pots, on which we place found eggs and caterpillars and then bring them inside for their protection until as adults they're ready to be released.  However, this year, knowing that I was going to have full left hip replacement surgery the beginning of July, it was clear that we were not going to be able to do the same this summer, which was just as well because when our potted milkweeds began sprouting this Spring, they quickly were attacked by hordes of oleander aphids.  The same soon became true for the various milkweeds we have planted outside our house.  Not a good year for healthy milkweeds, at least not in our neighborhood.<P>Granted, following my surgery thus far this summer, I'm not yet able to be out and about much, so my opportunities for observing Monarchs are pretty limited.  And up until Friday (7/26/2019) we'd yet to spot any Monarchs on the wing or to find any eggs or caterpillars this year on our outside milkweed plants; just lots of aphids. &nbsp; &nbsp; :-(<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  - Tim<P>P.S. - See my Monarch reports (to be posted soon) for 7/26/2019 and 7/27/2019 for some better news about local Monarch eggs, caterpillars, and butterflies. &nbsp; &nbsp; :-) ",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/07/1526411651.jpg,9984469,-999999.999,1,Milkweed Sighted,0
