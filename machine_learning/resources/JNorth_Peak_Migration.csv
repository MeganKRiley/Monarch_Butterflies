Normally on this island Monarchs favor north or northwest winds for migration, but today the north wind's fury is forcing them down to the ground. If they're lucky enough to land on vegetation--dune grasses or Seaside Goldenrod, they cling to the leeward side, staying 3-5 minutes to rest and warm their flight muscles in the sun. Others, not so lucky are landing on the exposed sand and are trying to get a foothold on the loose, blowing grains of sand.

This past weekend, the weather was sunny, warm days with cool nights, and I was just ahead of a low pressure system.  I anticipated many more monarchs this week.

There were many hundreds of plants of the Rough Blazing Star in full flower and the Monarchs were making good use of them. There was good evidence that the Monarchs were roosting in the trees surrounding the glade and were coming from these roosts directly onto the glade to nectar on these plants. <br>I had seen a number of mating Monarchs at this glade earlier in the season and the glade also supports a number of species of native milkweeds which are utilized by the Monarchs. The temperatures today reached around 80 degrees or so and it was a bright sunny day with a light to moderate breeze for most of the day. Coincidentally there were many other species of butterflies present in large numbers also.    The Monarchs were also using several other species as nectar sources, including wild oregano (Cunila origanoides) and several species of goldenrod (Solidago species).<br>    This was probably one of the best days for Monarchs that I have ever seen, given the numbers and the fact that many of them were also fresh and very brightly colored.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,1580,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

About 5:30, as I was standing on the shell beach road about fifty feet from edge of the bay, there were hundreds of monarchs milling around me, that then slowly dispersed northward to the clustering sites.  There were a few, very few, that flew on across the bay after 5:45. After 5:45, I started looking, and the best cluster in a three foot square had about 75 monarchs in it.  Clusters were forming up and down the beach as far as I could see, on brush and taller weeds along the shell beach.  <P> We've tried for years to figure out where the monarchs that were trying to cross the bay in October and November might cluster for the night.  This was the first time to be in the right place. I was standing in the middle of hundreds that were milling around between 5:30 and sunset about 5:45.

The butterflies travel way up high and are easier to see against a white backdrop."" Sure enough! Monarchs were flooding southward on the strong north wind (20+ mph). It took a minute or two to train my eye, then suddenly I saw them, zipping by as fast as the wind. I counted 86 in 5 minutes. Each darted across my field of vision in just 5-6 seconds. (In contrast, I saw an average of 7 per minute while driving along the highway.) <P>The trick was seeing the first one; it seemed to take a minute or two. Then others at higher and higher altitudes came into view. Those highest were tiny dots, so there must have been others too high to be seen even with binoculars. All were traveling in exactly the same direction. They looked like tiny paper airplanes folded identically, with wings pitched for an effortless glide. Had they had vapor trails behind them, like passing jets, every line of travel would have been parallel. <P>Whenever I took my binoculars down, to look with my naked eye, the entire scene vanished. I couldn't see anything but clouds and blue sky! <P>I had parked on a quiet dirt road and was using the open car door to steady my hands. At one point a gruff old farmer stopped in his pickup and asked suspiciously if I needed directions. ""I'm watching butterflies!"" I said exuberantly, pointing at the empty sky.""They're migrating to Mexico! Do you want to see?"" He broke into a smile, got out of his truck, and we watched together for awhile. (He became, in a word, chatty: ""Oh my! There they are! I see them! Why do they fly so high? Does it take much energy to float like that? How long does it take to get to Mexico?"" etc.) <P>As I drove back to the city I just couldn't believe the migration was still taking place right over my head. Twice I stopped to look again. There they were, silently streaming by like shooting stars. As I drove on, I wondered about other everyday miracles that take place beyond our notice. <P>I also saw many southbound dragonflies, and tree swallows hawking other insects riding high on the winds. <P>Don't forget your binoculars the next time you go out to see the migration!

This was mostly observed from our place 5 km NE of Utopia in SW Bandera Co.., but we ranged southeast as noted.<p> By noon I had seen a few Monarchs in the yard, passing south (S) to southsouthwest (SSW). By 1 it was about 6-8. At 1:30 I saw 5 at once, and grabbed my binocs and started scanning. 1:32 to 1:37 standing at one end of my porch I was counting 100 perminute. All going S to SSW. They were everywhere. Up high 100', groupsthermalling. I walked around trying to get a vantage point from the bowl we're in, and for a half hour, anywhere you looked you saw a hundred as fast as youcould count them. A minute.  I would look east, and count a hundred within one binoc field of view, within a quarter mile, and it was the same to thewest behind me. <p>Between 2:10 & 2:30 it seemed to slow to 50 per minute in everydirection. It seemed to me that ten thousand passed at minimum in the hour, and itwas likely twice that, or more. This was a slice of a kilometer or so width,of a mass of unknown width. So we headed to town (Utopia) 5 km SW. All along the way the river continued in density as fast as you could count them(100/min. approx). The town was full of them, but shortly after getting north oftown they decreased rapidly. There were only small numbers of them at LostMaples SNA later in the afternoon. <p>However back here at the adobe, at 6:30 p.m. theywere still going over to the SSW at the rate of 10 per minute. This leads me tobelieve they continued in high numbers here (after I left), for some time. Theywere not further north in the valley, and were clearly coming into the SabinalRiver Valley from the NE, mid valley or so.....  anyway, some settled in and are roosting,so there should be a liftoff tomorrow.   It was some moving movent moments. The passage lasted probably 5 hours, with a 2-3 hour peak, and it was at leasta couple kilometers wide, with therefore thousands per hour.

It was not moving at all.  Today was one of our few cloudy days all summer, with temps in the lower 70s.

Today and yesterday we did not see any at all.<p> <B> Wednesday, September 14: Monarchs 0</B><br>For the first time in more than a month, <B>we found no monarchs at all</B> at the three sites we have been monitoring.  We had some overnight storms, but the rain ended long before dawn and had probably passed over Lake Michigan before any monarchs would have departed Michigan this morning.  We'll keep monitoring over the next several days and let you know if things change appreciably.

We counted <B>119 total </B>at the three locations.  At one site, however, grounds crews had just finished sprinkling again, so that could have had some impact on the numbers there.  Temperature 84 degrees Fahrenheit.  On the lakeshore, east winds still dominated.<p><B>September 8: Monarchs 145</B><br>After climbing for the last three days, our monarch numbers <B>fell to 145 total</B> for the three locations today.  Still a substantial number compared to past years at this time.  Our storm last night was very brief and came after dark, so it probably did not have much effect on migration.  Temperature 77 degrees Fahrenheit, winds from the east.<p><B> Wednesday, September 7: Monarchs 240</B><br>Our monarch count at the three locations continued to go up today.  We saw <B>at least 240</B>,  including some arriving at the hydrangeas from the beach.  The east wind was a little stronger today.  Temperature, under sunny skies, was 84 degrees Fahrenheit.  We have storms predicted for tonight, and possibly tomorrow, so we will see how that affects the migration.<p>After staying low through Sunday, the monarch count at the three nectaring locations I've been monitoring took a surprising turn on Monday.  Here are the daily reports:<p><B>Tuesday, September 6: Monarchs 219</B><br>Our monarch count jumped to a total of <B>at least 219</B>--the highest we have ever observed!  It was difficult to count them accurately, as individuals kept rising, floating above the hydrangeas, then coming to rest again.  But, with my husband, Jim, assisting me, I believe we got a pretty accurate count.  Winds were from the east, temperature 84 degrees Fahrenheit.  We have been watching the monarch migration closely for several years, and we do seem to be seeing more than usual this year.  For the most part, conditions have been ideal for crossing Lake Michigan from the east and northeast--warm, mild, no storms.  The drought we have been experiencing here may actually be helping the monarchs.  Some years, we see scores washed up on the Lake Michigan beaches after being caught in storms while crossing the lake.<p> <B>Monday, September 5: Monarchs 121</B><br>To our surprise and delight, the monarch count at our nectaring locations soared to <B>121</B>--a new peak--today!  The jump surprised us, since the southeast winds would have made migration across Lake Michigan more difficult than on recent days.  Of course, we do not know what the conditions were in Michigan when they started out this morning.  It was a sunny day, with temperatures in the mid-80s.<p> <B>Sunday, September 4: Monarchs 13</B><br>Our count jumped to <B>13</B> under partly cloudy skies, temperature about 80 again, wind from the east.  Two of the nectaring monarchs may not have been migrating, or, if they were, they faced a more difficult journey than most.  One was very faded and missing half of one forewing.  The other was battered, with crimped forewings that did not extend completely. <p><B>Saturday, September 3: Monarchs 7</B><br>We saw only <B>7 </B>monarchs at the hydrangea nectaring sites.  Temperature about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  Sunny.  Throughout the afternoon and evening, we saw perhaps <B>10</B> more high-flying monarchs heading west.<p><B>September 2: Monarchs 7</B><br>Our nectaring monarch population had a very slight uptick today--a total of <B>7 </B>at the three sites.  We saw one of the monarchs flying across the beach to nectar at the hydrangeas nearest to Lake Michigan.  Today's northeast winds would have helped potential migrators from Michigan.  Temperature was about 80 degrees Fahrenheit under sunny skies.  Several cabbage whites, one painted lady, one sulphur, and one comma butterfly joined the monarchs at the hydrangeas.  <p><B>September 1: Monarchs 4</B><br>The monarch numbers at the three sites I am monitoring diminished even more today.  I saw only <B>four</B>--one at the first site, two at the second, one at the third.  The day was a bit hotter--83 degrees Fahrenheit--and the wind had diminished, but was still from the north.  The hydrangeas, a variety of hydrangea paniculata, still attract large numbers of hornets, spider wasps, and other wasps.  Last week we also saw about one painted lady a day among the monarchs, but we have not seen any this week.<p><B>August 31: Monarchs 13</B><br>The monarch numbers at the three observation sites on Northwestern University's campus continue to dwindle.  Today's total at about the same time was only <B>13</B>.  Temperature in the mid-70s, wind from the northeast.  Not as sunny as the last few days.<p> <B>August 30: Monarchs 22</B><br> Today, at about the same time, with similar conditions to the last few days, but with slightly stronger winds from the east, we saw only <B>22</B> total at the three sites.  At one site, however, the university grounds crew had just finished watering, so any monarchs could have been disturbed and flown off.  We did, however, see four on those hydrangeas, about the same as yesterday's five. <p><B>Monday, August 29: Monarchs 31</B><br> At the same time, we counted only <B>31</B> total.  East winds from Lake Michigan prevailed on all three days and temperatures ranged from upper 70s to low 80s under sunny skies. <p><B>August 27th and 28th: Monarchs 100</B><br>I may have seen the peak migration on Saturday and Sunday.  For about 2 weeks, I have been checking three groups of hydrangea plantings on Northwestern University's campus that attract migrating monarchs.

The year's first cold front had come through, windy and wet, on Friday.Saturday dawned bright and clear with a gentle northerly breeze. Sitting on the porch of our cabin with our morning coffee, looking out at the mountains to the south in Mexico, we noticed the Monarchs coming over and around the casa in greater and greater profusion.

Arriving at the sacred pool, I normally would have bathed but today decided not, perhaps fearing the chilling wind. I bouldered on down canyon to a grove of oaks, placing my feet carefully. I somehow sensed movement above me, perhaps the light changed or their wings pressed the air, and I looked quickly up to find the air full of hundreds of Monarchs, as though someone had shattered stained glass and thrown it dancing into the sky. I gasped and almost fell and quickly lowered myself to the rock canyon floor to watch, and then noticed how the trees were still dripping with butterflies, the creatures appended to every limb. A sudden whirling zephyr rushed through the canyon and instantly the Monarchs were formed into a golden whirlwind, the bright sunshine illuminating them against the shadowed gray stone cliff face. <P>Courtesy of Mike Quinn, Texas Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

In the email the text read """"hundreds of thousands"" monarchs on a 10 acre field of goldenrods. <B> The density is at least 100 monarchs per square meter</B>."" Given the email statement about 10 acres, I asked V three times about the size of the area and she assured me each time that it was a thousand acres. When I asked about the estimate of the number of monarchs, V told me that their <B>best guess is that 40-50 thousand monarchs were using the area at one time.</B><p>The monarchs arrived on Saturday the 7th and V and Carl have been making trips to the location each morning and evening since then. V gave this description of the exodus from the field each evening. <P>About 6:15 the monarchs begin to leave the flowers and head for the hedgerows to the north and east of the field. They do not appear to be using the hedgerow to the south (there are no trees to the west). Movement of the butterflies toward the trees accelerates by 6:30 and by 6:45 there is a virtual cloud of monarchs seeking places to roost in the trees - so much so that to observers they look like flocks of birds coming to roost. By 7PM all but a few of the monarchs are at rest in the trees.<P>This spectacle will probably end as a cold front moves through the area. The weather for tomorrow is expected to be in the low 60s with showers so the butterflies may not be able to leave the area until the skies clear and the temperature hit the low 60s on Friday.The Jeffers informed me that Jim Edson is on his way to the location so maybe Jim will be able to provide some clarifications and additional details.<P>There are two fields consists of about 1,000 acres of goldenrod, asters and a few other wildflowers. A drainage ditch with a tree line divided the fields. The monarchs were moving out of the fields to the trees by thethousands. I don't know how to estimate the numbers, but the tree line isabout 0.5 miles long and all of the trees were full of monarchs. I haven'tseen anything like it except in Mexico.

So we know there were many monarchs passing by that were not counted.  Around 5:30, while Aubrie and I were still tagging, John and Carolyn noticed that the monarchs were beginning to alter their behavior.  Rather than moving on through, the butterflies began to circle back and remain in the area.  When our tags were depleted (and most of our energy!) we sat on the grass and enjoyed watching dozens of monarchs nectaring on the goldenrod and asters six feet in front of us.  As the light faded and the temperature dropped we watched intently, hoping to discover where the monarchs would roost for the night.  The leeward side of a nearby oak tree seemed to be the favored spot.  As the chill began to affect us as well, we decided to end our wonderful day on the Blue Ridge and head to our own roosting sites.

Afterward I did a 15-minute walk around the east and west sides of the Point and counted 52 more nectaring Monarchs. During the same period Jean kept watch at the observatory and counted 20 others that were migrating past without stopping.So there was a good flow of butterflies there today, probably upward of 100 actually present at the time, and turning over constantly (all seven tagged individuals flew west immediately). If we had had more tags, we could have had quite a productive day, but our Monarch tagging for summer 2007 is now completed.<p>Contributed by Don Davis",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9701709,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

A local farmer called me approximately at noon and indicated that he had seen a huge amount of monarchs adjacent to a field in the Neosho river bottom. <B>I went to the location with the presumption that I might see a few hundred or even a few thousand monarchs. The population was much greater.</B> Obviously, I cannot give you an accurate amount or even a valid estimate. I do know that it was very large. The monarchs were located in a woods adjacent to a field of sunflowers that I would say was at least 400 acres. The sunflowers were in full bloom. The wood circles the entire field. In addition, there is a levee which is approximately 15 feet tall. <p>Sunday, we had a strong southerly breeze that was probably 20 to 30 miles per hour with stronger gusts. I don't know if the monarchs had congregated because of the nectar source, the strong southerly winds, and the protection provided by the woods and levees, or for some other reason. Regardless, it was one of those once in a lifetime experiences. Many were clinging to the leaves of the trees and many more were flying in the wood and the open fields to the North of the levee and tree line. As indicated, it would be impossible to estimate the total. As you probably now I have been to Sierra Chincua and Rosario. While these butterflies were not that dense, there certainly was a large concentration. <B>I know at least in the tens of thousands. </B>I followed the tree line around the sunflower field for approximately ½ mile in both directions and the concentration seemed to be uniformed the whole 1 mile distance. Many of the trees had a dense concentration of butterflies. The butterflies were not hanging from each other in a curtain effect but they were dense. The trees located right on the levees did not exceed15 to 20 feet in height.<p>While my amateur observation may be incorrect the butterflies appeared to me to be in fairly good shape overall. They appeared to have fairly plump bodies, fairly large wing spans, and overall there wings appeared to be in fairly good shape. Quite frankly, I was a little worried at least about the monarch local population. I did not have nearly as many caterpillars this year in my Waystation stations as last year. I was hopeful that this was due to the fact that we have had lots of rain and lots of wildflowers so they were not concentrating on flower gardens as much. Regardless of that issue, I certainly saw a huge amount of monarchs yesterday. I don't know how long they have been there or how long they will be staying. It rained last night, a front is going through, and the wind may change. I am going to check the location tonight to see if they are still there.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

The night time temp this time of the year, falls to about 30-40 degrees. This was the 2nd time in 2 weeks that I've traveled to the Parkway to see the Monarch's, I was pleasantly surprised on both occasions, I saw plenty of butterflies. Once the butterfly's come up over the tree tops from the north, they gently glide south, down the other side of the the mountain into South Carolina.<p>I did notice something unusual when I was observing on 10.14.07, I noticed this reaction on about 5 butterflies, they were flying and all of a sudden it almost appeared that they hit something, of course it was only air, they appeared to be knocked back, but then they adjusted their route and continued on....I had never seen this before.

Yesterday morning (10/24/07) just as the sun was first hitting my yard, I walked along the outer edge, checking butterflies that might be sunning. The trees and high shrubs contained 120 to 150 Monarchs, most perched with wings spread, warming their bodies. Very few other butterflies were active that early. Within a half hour or so the Monarchs begin to move to my numerous crucitas shrubs (Eupatorium odoratum) to feed. At any one time I could see 25-30 individuals close together on a couple sunny sites. Within the next couple hours they began moving about, sampling nectar on my numerous crucitas and/or white mistflower shrubs (Epatorium wrightii); few also utilizing duranta shrubs. This action continued until about noon. Gradually, apparently after adequately feeding, individuals began to move off, all seemingly heading southward, some fly low but most 20 to 50 feet above the ground. This southward movement continued for much of the afternoon. But more individuals appeared from the north, flying over the adjacent treeline to drop into my yard to feed. It seemed that at no time all day did I have less than 100 (est) individuals visible at any time. By late afternoon, with the sun still highlighting a number of crucitas, feeding activity continued at a high pitch. It seemed that fewer individuals were moving off; the vast majority of the activity was centered around the sunny patches of crucitas. During the last ten years that I have been paying attention to my yard butterflies, yesterday's Monarch numbers represented an all-time high. I will repeat my visits again today. Other obvious ""migrants"" included Cloudless and Large Orange Sulphurs, both American and Painted Ladies, Red Admirals, and Queens.<P>Report courtesy of Mike Quinn, via Texas Butterfly Listserv",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

This day began with  temperatures across central Iowa in the low 40s, but the sunny  weather stirred up monarch movement once again. <B>During two hours of observations in the mid-afternoon at  Neal Smith National  Wildlife  Refuge, we counted the largest total yet  for this fall--545 monarchs.</B> In the first 30 minutes, we counted about 250 monarchs  nectaring on tickseeds in the northern edge of the refuge. What a delight to see them racing here and there  over the wildflowers.<p><B>September 11</B><br>Rain had fallen earlier, and a light mist was dampening the area in Neal Smith Wildlife Refuge. But as the mist subsided around 11 a.m., monarchs began flying over the tickseeds in the north of the refuge. The sun began coming out from behind the clouds, and monarch activity picked up. By noon, 100 monarchs were observed, and then in the early afternoon, the pace of movement picked up considerably in other parts of the refuge. In three hours of observing,<B> 300 monarchs </B>were noted--providing a lesson on how the butterflies deal with moisture, strong winds, sunlight, and clouds.<p><B>September 13</B><br>Following a day and one-half of rainy weather, we visited Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in the late afternoon looking for monarchs. The day still was cloudy, but we began seeing some monarch activity in the north of the refuge. To the south where the prairie meets oak woods on a hillside, we discovered monarchs flying out from the oaks to nectar on the prairie wildflowers. Then they returned to several roosts on the hillside oak trees. Great viewing. <B>We counted 190 monarchs, </B>but the numbers in the roosting areas surely were higher as the monarchs were swirling around our heads and stopping on the oak branches.<p><B>September 14</B><br>Three hours of morning observations turned  up <B>220 monarch  butterflies</B>--many of which were dealing with a strong northwest wind of 20 to 30 miles an hour. The monarchs were stopping on oak trees in the south of Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, and struggling across the prairie for nectaring on wildflowers. The sun came out  from behind the clouds for a time, and the monarch activity picked up. While observing the monarchs, I found one caught in a  spider web. I took it out of the web, cleaned its wings of the webbing, held it up to  the sky, and watched it fly  hundreds of feet up  to the top  of an oak  tree!<p><B>September 15</B><br>A sunny day on the prairie brought out strong monarch butterfly activity at Neal  Smith National  Wildlife Refuge. Most of the monarchs appeared to be moving away from their favorite wildflowers of the past week--tickseed sunflowers--and were turning instead to sawtooth sunflowers for their nectaring. During three hours of observation in the afternoon, <B>384 monarchs were counted</B>--especially on the taller sawtooth sunflowers.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9703854,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

They were flying, slightly higher than the tree tops, in a south/southwestward direction. <P><B>6:15- 6:50 p.m</B><br>The numbers picked up sharply around 6:15 p.m. until about 6:50 p.m. From about 3 to 5 per minute beginning about 6:15 p.m. until about 6:40, and then 5 to 10 per minute until about 6:50 p.m. They were still slightly over the tree tops but occasionally dipping down a little lower....but still not coming down to nectar on the flowers. They were still headed west/southwest, although perhaps a little more westward than earlier. <P><B>6:50-7:10 p.m.</B><br>From about 6:50 until about 7:10, the party was on! I stood in our driveway, with our woodland about 75' to my north and the neighbors' woodland about 60' to my south. The monarchs were coming through at the rate of about 25 per minute from 6:50 to 7:00 p.m. and then at about 50 per minute until 7:10 or so. <P><B>7:10 to 7:15 p.m.</B><br>Then they tapered off pretty rapidly to about 5 to 10 per minute from 7:10 to 7:15 or so and then 1 to 4 per minute until about 7:20. Then, that was it. It was over. <B>The last wave, from 6:50 onward, was clearly seeking a tree to roost in. They flew down into the trees and sort of flew from tree to tree as they went from our woods to the neighbors' woodsand I lost sight of them. (There were approximately 300+ monarchs.)</B>  I think some of them stayed in the oaks and pecans on the edge of our woods, but it was too dark to tell for sure. I'll check those trees at first light in the morning. <P>It was an amazing couple of hours, especially as sunset approached.   It was about 82 degrees at 4:30, and there was alight wind out of the north, about 5-7 m.p.h. By 7 p.m., it probably had dropped to 73 or 74 degrees and the wind had virtually stopped blowing.<P>During the very late 1990s and very earliest 2000s, we had hundreds, if not thousands, roost on a very tall and mature dying elm on the edge of our woods. They covered the almost bare limbs to the extent that the tree looked like it had leaves again. It was an exquisitely beautiful sight....and we have not seen those numbers here in over half a decade. <P><B>6:00 a.m. (October 1)</B><br>I think mine may have chosen the neighbor's woods, and that area is so snake-infested, I cannot get near those trees to see if they did. Of course, maybe I'll find some roosting in our trees when the sun comes up....DHthought they did, but I think they flew ""through"" our trees on their way next door. It is 46 degrees on my back porch, as of 6 a.m., so I think I can get out and check my own trees before the snakes start stirring.<P>Apparently our overnight low temp. (42 degrees) kept the monarchs hanging in their trees for a few hours this morning until it warmed up. I didn't see any the first hour or so after sunrise, but finally began seeing some activity....monarchs coming up out of the crowns of the trees where they'd probably roosted overnight.<P><B>9:30 a.m</B><br>By 9:30 a.m., they were leaving the trees, nectaring in the pastures (and our yard and garden!), and flying southwestward. For about a half hour, I saw them at the astonishing (for me!) rate of 25 to 50 per minute (or maybe even a little more). At that point it was about 55 degrees, no wind, endless visability except for low fog banks over parts of the Red River. They stayed low, nectaring, as they flew towards the southwest. That lasted 20 or 25 minutes, and then it dropped to about 10 to 15 per minute. <P><B>11 a.m.</B><br>By 11 a.m., the temperature was up to about 60 degrees, still great visability and no wind. I guess most of the monarchs were flying high by then, because I was only seing 1 to 5 per minute.<P>So, a pretty good start to the day. I plan to be in and out a lot this afternoon, so maybe I'll see more. Tonight I plan to be outside from late afternoon to sunset to see if we have a repeat of last night's numbers. I think I'll just take my dinner outside and eat on the patio, 'cause last night I stayed out so long watching themthat I skipped dinner (and woke up starving this morning!).

We didn't see any Monarchs until we noticed some golden rod right outside the entrance gate to the park.  There was a large patch of flowers there and 100's of Monarchs. We then headed to St. Joseph Peninsula State park and it was later in the day and we did see Monarchs there, but not too many.  So we either didn't find where the Monarchs were nectaring or it may be early in the season yet for them. Our last stop before heading home was St. Andrews State park in Panama City.  We saw lots of Monarchs and many other butterflies here (Gulf Frits, Buckeyes, Long-tailed skippers, two species of Sulphurs and some Skippers).  The main area they were in was along the trail by the tuppentine still.  Part of the trail is along the Grand Lagoon water area.

My kids (ages 5 and 8), my husband, and I spent 3 days over Thanksgiving vacation at Pacific Grove's Monarch Grove Sanctuary on Ridge Rd.  We were stunned to find only 760 butterflies, down from 19,000 that were seen on Thanksgiving day last year.  We went to Natural Bridges State Park in Santa Cruz on Friday, and found the same thing--only 1400 butterflies instead of the usual 50,000.  It appears the numbers are down all along the California coast.  In talking with naturalists and various other officials, much speculation is going on as to what has caused the drop in numbers.  Most are hoping that due to the unusually warm Fall weather, the monarchs are delayed in their migration--the next few weeks will tell if this is the case.  Every year, since the early '90s, the numbers of over-wintering monarchs have dropped in all sites along the coast--many are pointing to the loss of milkweed habitat to agricultural expansion, the use of Bt corn and Round-up ready soybeans, drought, and climate change.  It appears some whales in Monterey Bay did not migrate this year, as they usually do.  I don't know what is going on, but I am very concerned and I hope this is not the beginning of the end of the western migration.  Folks out there--PLEASE PLANT MILKWEED!

Monarchs were EVERYWHERE! The largest numbers I have seen in years of hawkwatching and/or parkway trips. It was difficult not to hit them. They were migrating, though slowed by the SE winds.<P> I stopped at the hawkwatch for a couple hours in early afternoon at Harvey's Knob before resuming my journey. (The sky was raining stinkbugs. The whole place SMELLED of stinkbugs when I got out of the car. ) You could not look up into the sky without seeing many, many monarchs drifting on the wind. They were up high, down low, everywhere. It took some doing to distinguish monarchs from birds, initially, because the birds were flying pretty high up. Just thought you would want to know. If there is a wave of monarchs moving down the Blue Ridge at the moment (I drove from Reid's Gap to just north of Boone before beginning to run out of daylight), the crest of the wave is currently close to Roanoke, according to my observations. And there are SO many in the crest! A very heartening sight. I figure that my doing my program at the Orchard on Sunday will be right at the height, totally serendipitously, as the north wind that we endured at Rockfish Gap that was driving the monarchs south a few days ago had swung around to the SW/S/SE on Tues. and Wed., slowing things down.

With the rising sun, their flight muscles warmed and they lifted off. Feeling the tug of a strong west wind, they surrendered to it and found themselves sailing over Chesapeake Bay. Some glided just above the car rooftops on the eastbound lanes of the 4-mile bay bridge; others soared over the white-capped waves. They weren't alone. Their fellow travelers-- common buckeyes and green darners rode the same wind. They made landfall at Terrapin Park on the eastern shore. The monarchs drifted over the sand, through the Spartina and Phragmites, over the freshwater ponds to the fields. The wind was perfumed with the seductive scent of tickseed sunflower. Masses of golden flowers lured monarchs down into the fields by the hundreds. By mid-morning the wind picked up to 15-20mph. By late afternoon, monarch numbers had increased to several thousand. Standing amidst of this dance of swirling orange wings and gold petals, I felt infused with energy. I also felt grateful for being able to witness this scene and knew that it would not have been possible without the managed fields. The fields were planted and are maintained by the Anne Arundel County Parks Dept. They could have kept this area as mowed grass for visitors to play frisbee on. Instead they put in the time/effort to create a habitat-- an old field stage of succession with an emphasis on native warm-season grasses. <P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

I immediately thought that an early falcon flight was starting! His next sentence was, ""The monarchs here are crazy"". I smirked inwardly (and outwardly) and told myself I was not really interested in spending time during what *might* be the only day I take off of work this week up on the platform counting butterflies. Sure, we take down monarch numbers here and there, when a big movement is going on, but...it is a HAWKwatch, after all. <P>I was birding with Cyrus Moqtaderi at Prime Hook when I got a second call 20 minutes later. It was Doug again. Cameron Cox and Michael O'brien were there. Doug implored that I get over to the hawkwatch and start counting butterflies. I said the equivalent of ""yeah yeah yeah, yada yada yada"". I heard Cameron yelling at me in the background. Michael got on the phone and...I quote: ""Forrest, get over there. This is like getting 500 Golden Eagles. You've GOT to see this."" We decided, given that we were notified by 3 of the best birders in Cape May County (and the country), that we should get ourselves over to the Hawkwatch Platform. Cyrus and I arrived at the Cape Henlopen Hawkwatch platform at 10:15am to something on the magnitude of 50 Monarchs a minute. By 11:00am I was counting 100's of monarchs PER BINOCULAR VIEW at any given instant all up and down the beach!!!! It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. I will never forget. <P>Looking South, North, straight up in the air, one could not avoid seeing thousands of Monarchs pouring forth over the Ocean! For an hour, we marveled, and spoke of similar amazing migrations. We estimated an  discussed and smiled. We forgot about Falcons and Hawks and whatnot. We stood, watching, smiling some more. Onlookers on the beach were watching from under umbrellas. People in parking lots carrying coolers, and chairs, were watching. Everyone that had seen, was watching. <P>The spectacle slowed and was mere memory by 12:30pm, give or take. Things returned the constant trickle of some few hundred Monarchs per hour. It was over nearly as quickly as it began. <P> I spoke to Doug Gochfeld this morning. <B>The rough estimate from Cape May was that 1.4 million Monarchs had migrated over the point between then hours of 7 and 9am. At the Cape Henlopen Hawkwatch we had seen some 550,000 - 600,000 of that. Reports from Rehoboth Beach/Gordon's Pond were upwards of 150,000. </B><P>The rest came ashore between the two points, delighting and confusing and astonishing beach-goers, and hawkwatchers, as they went. I have seen Monarchs migrating each Fall for 4 years. I have seen them waft and weave in and out of view; overhead, over flowers, and thought these sights happy and amusing, but never impressive. I hereby beg forgiveness. <P>    Good Bir....ummm...everything, ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

Maybe it was blown off course by the storms? He is presently relaxing in a box and will hopefully make it back to Woods Hole, MA with us in a few days where he will be very disappointed and have to start migration all over again!<P>We were about 120 miles from shore when we discovered the butterfly. We left Woods Hole, Mass. on Sept. 10 and have been offshore since then.Â  Just about 1 1/2 days before the monarch turned up we had that weather system go through that dumped so much rain on the Carolinas.Â  We had 35-40 knot winds and swell averaging about 20 feet. (That was pretty rough for us, and science work was suspended while the system passed.)Â  The butterfly, oddly, turned up in the galley near the breakfast fruit (That's why I thought it might like the syrupy peach that I gave it.)  I don't think it was a stowaway;  I think it would have been discovered in the three weeks we've been out here.Â  I feel certain that it was blown out here during the storm.Â  We also had several birds and other insects show up, too. <P>I am a regular on the R/V Atlantis.Â  I work with various scientists from around the world (oceanographers, marine biologists, geologists, etc.) and help them collect oceanographic data.Â  Our ship also carries the submersible Alvin. (I am assisting with an Alvin recovery in this picture.) Alvin takes scientists down to as far as 4500 meters below the surface to do research.Â  I, unfortunately, only get to ride occasionally on top of it on the surface :)Â  This trip is mostly scientists studying the chemistry of the water column. (Alvin is on the ship, but not diving this time around.) You can view the cruise track for the R/V Atlantis at sssg1.whoi.edu (we're in red)<P>Unfortunately our lonely traveler did not live through the night.Â  I'd put him/her in a box (with just an open top) and sugar water and a syrupy peach hoping he/she would eat something.Â  It was probably pure exhaustion because he/she sat on the edge of a paper bowl all day barely moving (like I said the top was open and it did not have very high sides, just enough for protection, but no attempts to escape were made).Â  I have placed the ""remains"" out on the deck hoping that one of the stowaway birds might benefit and the butterfly will not have died in vain.Â I was saddened that this little guy gave up after such an exciting journey! <p><img src=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/fall_atlantic_atlantis1286036494_1_640.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""500"" alt=""Monarch in the Atlantic Ocean""></p><p><img src=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/fall_atlantic_atlantis1286036494_2_640.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""500"" alt=""Monarch in the Atlantic Ocean""></p>",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9948871,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

The previous day Tropical Storm Nicole passed through. I observed over a six hour period over 700 monarchs. Unlike my last spotting two weeks ago where the monarchs came in droves over a shorter period in time, on this day the arrivals were spread out over many hours. The majority of monarchs looked strong, healthy and were eager to feed on golden rod nectar, a few had torn wings but were just as diligent to feed. At sunset they roosted in a much larger area. Their predecessors two weeks before, where hundreds of monarchs roosted on one pine tree, today there were 10 -40 on a tree, but many more trees.On the next day I only spotted 30 over a 5 hour period. I can't figure out when they leave the South Shore of Long Island, if they fly out over the Atlantic Ocean to their next stop or do they fly west along the coast and skirt New York City?

The wind this morning was WSW at 4-8mph, low enough windspeed that monarchs could fly against it. However, they seem not to be migrating today. They are congregating in the stands of seaside goldenrod that are protected from the wind by taller vegetation (bayberry and groundsel-tree). <p> Good news-- I stood on the beach for 15 minutes and saw 5 monarchs per minute flying in to shore from out over the ocean. When I followed them with binoculars, I saw them land in the nearest stand of seaside goldenrod. I was able to pluck them off with my hand, tag them and set them right back on the flowers, where they stayed and continued nectaring. <p> Low tide is at 2:35pm, so I am off to check the ocean beach for any monarchs that may have washed up. More later.<p>Oct 7, 2:30-5:30pm, Chincoteague NWR, Assateague Island, VA<p>Monarchs continued to nectar in the seaside goldenrod; tagged monarchs had not moved from the plants they were on this morning. The wind speed increased to 13-16mph WSW and I observed a dozen or so monarchs leave their perches and get blown down to the ocean edge, but they were able (with constant flapping) to make their way back to vegetation. I walked about 2 miles south toward the hook and checked all the patches of seaside goldenrod in the remaining interdune areas, and there were several hundred more monarchs hunkered down in those spots. At 5:30 the wind decreased a bit, and I watched the ocean for a while to see if any monarchs would return to shore. I didn't see any, but I was surprised to see dozens of green darner dragonflies returning to shore.  <p>Earlier today I spoke with my friend Dick Roberts who is the local birdbander, and he told me that some of the smaller songbirds also get blown out to sea on days with strong west winds. He sets up his mist nets to capture them as they make landfall. Just as the monarchs use up fat in their constant flapping to get back to land, so do the songbirds. Dick checks for fat on the abdomen of the birds by blowing on their belly feathers. The skin is transparent and you can see if the birds have any yellow fat or not. The birds that have been out over the ocean are lean, with no fat at all. So, monarchs are not the only ones who suffer on days with strong west winds over this island. <p>Since I am always in view of visitors, I am often approached by curious people wanting to know what I am doing. The interpretive naturalist in me will not let me pass up an opportunity to tell the monarch's story, so I spend a lot of time talking with people. Today a woman asked me what kind of fish I was catching with my long-handled net.

At sunrise there was no dew, the temp was 58 degrees with full sun and wind NNW at 4mph. As soon as the sunlight touched them, the monarchs were off their roosts and in the air. They soared from a few feet off the ground to about 30-50' high. Some flew higher and I could see them only with binoculars. There was a constant stream of monarchs drifting by (what a sight!) until about 9am, when the wind became WNW at 8mph. Monarchs continued to migrate but flew just over the waves as they broke on the shore. They faced the direction they wanted to go (southwest), but they flew sideways to the south, flapping all the time to keep themselves from going out over the ocean. I sat on the primary dune and watched each one with binoculars and none that I watched went out over the ocean. I did a few site counts and the average was 27 monarchs per minute. The migration continued like this until 11:45am when there was an abrupt halt to the wind. It became very still and then monarchs started dropping down into the seaside goldenrod to nectar.  At 12:15pm the wind had shifted and was WSW at 9mph.  Within minutes there were hundreds of cloudless sulphurs swirling around the seaside goldenrod. The monarchs and the sulphurs were nectaring by the hundreds in the seaside goldenrod areas. Now at 2:30, the wind is SSW, which should keep all the monarchs here the remainder of the day. I am headed back now to look for tagged monarchs in the goldenrods, and to tag some of my own.<p>Oct 8, 3pm - 5:30pm, Chincoteague NWR, Assateague Island, VA<p> Birders always hope for a ""fallout"" of warblers during spring and fall migration. I have seen a few fallouts at places like Cape May NJ and Dolly Sods, WVA . It is a wondrous event you remember forever. In all my years here at Chincoteague, I had never seen a fallout of monarchs--- until this afternoon.  <p>Every flower stalk of every seaside goldenrod plant in the interdune area along Tom's Cove had multiple monarchs nectaring on it. I have never seen that many monarchs nectaring in one place at one time. One year early in my study I had about 10,000 monarchs roosting in a wild black cherry tree. But today in the interdune area, there may have been several hundred thousand monarchs. I walked one mile along the shore of Tom's Cove and still did not reach the end of the nectaring monarchs.  <p>I am glad I had several witnesses and that I took photos until my memory card filled. I searched for tagged monarchs but didn't see any. The monarchs were so intent on feeding that I was able to capture them by hand, tag them and put them back on the flowers. I was so focused on the monarchs that I didn't realize I had an entourage of visitors who were filming and photographing the process. People who had never seen a monarch were just in awe. Well, so were the rest of us! The event sparked lots of questions, so when all my tags were used up, I sat down in the sand and spoke about monarchs until everyone's questions were answered.  I will never forget this day. . .And, I can't wait to see what happens tomorrow when winds will be out of the NW.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0
37131,1286813108,2010-10-09,Monarch PEAK Migration,1,37.954,-75.317,0,"Oct 9, 7am-9am, Chincoteague NWR, Assateague Island, VA <p>I arrived on the beach 10 minutes before sunrise. I was hoping there would be a mass liftoff of all  the monarchs that I thought had roosted in the seaside goldenrod last night.  But that was not the case. I left the beach at 5:30pm last night and my guess is that the winds died down just before sunset and the monarchs flew north back up the beach to the remaining thickets of bayberry/groundsel-tree/marsh elder. They had scattered throughout the thickets and roosted there. I was very surprised to see some roosting on the bare exposed branches of dead eastern red-cedar trees. I found this to be very interesting because these were the very trees that held large monarch roosts when they were alive and full of dense conifer branches.  <p>At 7:10am this morning, the temp was 62 degrees with full sun, no humidity or dew, and a NW wind at 4mph. Most monarchs were off the roost by 7:25am, but others continued to leave a few at a time until 7:45am. Even though conditions were perfect for migration, I did not see any engaging in directional flight. They swirled around as if testing the air, but then landed in the seaside goldenrod and began nectaring. By 8:15am they had all settled back into the seaside goldenrod. I thought that very odd, given the weather conditions, so I netted a few and saw that they had very lean abdomens (eat first, fly later). Unfortunately, by 9am the wind shifted and was W at 8mph. I saw a few monarchs lift off, got caught in the wind, flapped like crazy and still got blown down to the ocean edge. They were able to make it back to the goldenrod, but not without expending lots of energy. <p> It is 2:30pm now and the wind is WSW at 8-10mph. So the monarchs should still be nectaring. This island truly is a critical stopover for migrating monarchs. I hope they build up lots of fat during this layover. <p> I am heading back down to search the beach at low tide for any washed up monarchs. More later.<p>Oct 9, 3pm-5:30pm, Chincoteague NWR, Assateague Island, VA <p>Usually on this island, all the attention goes to the famous Chincoteague ponies. But today was different. Photographers were not set up at the pony pen; they were lining the sides of the causeway with their tripods and 2'-long lenses, photographing something none of us had ever seen. The wind shifted again and was straight out of the west, bringing common buckeyes, green darners and more monarchs by the thousands from the Delmarva and probably the mainland to this tiny island. Unbelieveable is the word that best describes the scene. If anyone is in the area, you may want to get yourself here before sunrise tomorrow. I couldn't even guess how many monarchs were here this afternoon. <p>The monarchs were engaging in a feeding frenzy on all three species of goldenrod in bloom. It was not like yesterday when they were so mellow I could capture them with my fingers. Today they were skittish and would flush from the plants if I moved too quickly or got too close.  Perhaps it was because the west wind was 10-15mph and they were getting quite a ride on the flower stalks. This time I had my video camera and filmed through two batteries and cassettes. When I return home I will post some footage on YouTube. But there were so many people filming today, you might be able to find one of their videos on it right now. <p>At exactly 5 pm, the wind shifted again, and was NW at 4-5mph. The wind speed was low enough that the monarchs could fly back to shore from out over the ocean. And as I walked the beach looking for dead monarchs I started seeing monarchs returning to shore about 3 per minute. I followed their path and saw them landing in closest clump of seaside goldenrod. Wait til you see the photo; it was one crowded plant. <p>I have not seen the weather forecast for Sunday and I don't know what to expect. But you can bet I will be out there well before sunrise to witness what happens next.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

The beads of water on their wings glistened with the first rays of sunlight. At 7:10am they spread their wings to bask. The weather conditions were full sun, 68 degrees, wind NE at 2mph, and humid (the salt marsh mosquitoes have been anxiously awaiting these conditions). At 7:25am the first monarchs lifted off, even though their wings still looked damp. It was finally time to leave this island  <p>I found a small roost in the shade and discovered one of the monarchs I tagged 3 days ago in almost the same spot. Thanks to the seaside goldenrod, his abdomen was noticeably larger than it was 3 days ago.<p> By 7:45am the NE wind had increased to 5mph. Most of the monarchs had lifted off and headed southwest toward Tom's Cove. I stood at the water's edge, happy to see that the surface was a mirror for the sky. I watched the monarchs fly out over the cove, turn around to head back to land then head back out again. They appeared to be testing the wind, to make sure it really was safe to cross water. I have never seen this hesitancy on good migration winds. Finally the monarchs relinquished their control to the wind and off they soared over calm blue water. Bye monarchs. Thank you for all the gifts you gave me this week. <p>By 9am there was not a monarch to be found anywhere. But at 9:30 the winds shifted and were ENE at 7mph-- perfect conditions to bring any monarchs still left at sea back to land. I will be out there waiting for them.<p>Oct 10, 1:30-5pm, Chincoteague NWR, Assateague Island VA <p>Monarchs started drifting in off the ocean to the beach during early afternoon east winds. They headed straight to the goldenrods and nectared for most of the afternoon.  We spent 2 hours hauling water and giving the seaside goldenrod plantings one last good soaking. As we watered, we saw small numbers of monarchs flying SW out over Tom's Cove. I didn't find any dead monarchs on the beach, but I did find several scattered piles of monarch wings in the interdune area. I think a swarm of green darners must have feasted on monarchs. <p>On the drive back to Chincoteague Island, we noticed monarchs flying right down Maddox Blvd, crossing over Main Street and going right up the ramp to the new bridge over Chincoteague Channel. Perhaps it is easier for them to fly over pavement instead of open water. I have also seen this behavior on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and on the above-ground sections of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel from Kiptopeke to Norfolk.  <p>I will be heading back to Maryland tomorrow, but one of my former research assistants will be here later this week. I look forward to hearing about her monarch observations through the 3rd week of October. I think anything is possible this migration season. <p>I am grateful for this special island, the monarchs that entice me here every year, those that help with and support my project, and the camaraderie of my fellow Monarch Watchers.

I went to what seems to be their favorite clump of white butterfly bushes, and this time found nearly a dozen of them, YAY!!! It's even possible there were more, as these bushes are massive by this time of year, both quite wide and quite tall; the monarchs were top-to-bottom and side-to-side, some even overhead, and none of them still. SO exciting to see them at their peak! Even got a photo of one in the sunshine when it peaked out briefly:-)<p>Am making a separate report for this particular National Zoo sighting as I saw these six monarchs at a totally different time of day, near sunset, which seemed unusual, as they were still nectaring at the white butterfly bushes like crazy!

I would've stayed even longer, but, unlike these butterflies, I wanted to head home before dark:-) I took some photos of course as again, couldn't quite believe it!

Usually sighted every year but this year my yard must be an oasis due to  drought because they are dense, seemingly hanging on every leaf and flower. (Magical!) <p>As to numbers, I&rsquo;d guess three or four thousand at peak.  We live very rural.  The drought has been devastating...nothing grew in the vegetable garden, and really not much even germinated with irrigation.  Non-irrigated pastures are bare.  Tanks are dry.  Central Texas has to this point registered 90 days of 100 degrees or more...and this started in May.  Trees are dying/dead all over the hilltops, even the mesquite and prickly pear is suffering.  However, my yard of less than 1/4 acre has had the benefit of daily irrigation to stay green (primarily for wildfire protection) but also to keep the flowers blooming for Hummers and  to save the big pecan trees(lost one of them to the 2009 drought).  So, this little spot is probably an oasis of sorts this year, but how did so many of the Monarchs find it, a needle in a haystack?  One other note, the barn swallows left several weeks ago, at least a month ahead of time, because of food shortage, I think.  Hope the Monarchs tanked up enough here to make it to the next green spot farther south, wherever that may be.<p><B>September 30</B><br>We had a cold front with RAIN overnight, so where yesterday there were thousands of Monarchs, today we have only tens, maybe 50 total.  Photos tend to be fuzzy due to windy conditions, but as you can see, the remaining butterflies tend to be getting nectar primarily from the native red salvia, but also appear to be getting something from the pecan leaves and an althea (rose-of-sharon).  A couple of my ten foot tall altheas did show evidence of aphids last week, but the Monarchs did not seem to prefer those bushes any more than anything else.  They also hung on to the hummingbird feeders, and probably visited the ground level water troughs (3) around the house perimeter, but I did not witness that specifically.   During the three-four days of huge populations, roosting was primarily in the old pecan trees on the north and east of the house.  The Hummingbirds too are really busy this morning getting stocked up for their own migration, hitting not only the salvia, but morning glories as well, saving the feeders for later in the day, I think.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/nectaring_masontx_1317313960_01.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/nectaring_masontx_1317313960_02.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/nectaring_masontx_1317313960_03.jpg"">",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9955737,4000.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

The average was about 600 per hour. Once they arrived at the narrow section of the island (about 100 yards between ocean and bay), they stopped to nectar on seaside goldenrod or they turned around and headed back over to the causeway. One side of the causeway has a freshwater impoundment and the other has a saltmarsh. The causeway is elevated so monarchs stayed low in the bayberry thicket at the edge of the marsh, completely out of the wind. The grounsel-tree (bushes) in this spot were loaded with nectaring monarchs all day. This is where I could safely tag and release them, without risking having them blow backwards out over the ocean. However it wasn't so safe for me because if I stood too long in one place, I would sink down about a foot into the soft mud, making me an easy target for the saltmarsh mosquitoes (the things we do for Monarch Watch . . .) <p>The winds remained from the NW all day, usually from 10-15mph, but picking up speed to about 20mph for an hour or two. By 6:30 there were some sizeable roosts forming along the causeway near the NPS visitor center in the bayberry bushes that had survived Irene, and in the bare branches of those that did not. I estimated about 5,000 monarchs in 7 separate roosts (that I could see from the road), but there were likely more in the dense thickets on the small islands in the freshwater impoundments, since I saw monarchs flying into them at dusk. This was one of those days that left lasting impressions, both in my memory and on my memory card. Monarchs, buckeyes, green darners, black saddlebags, Carolina saddlebags, wandering gliders, spot-winged gliders, Peregrine falcons, merlins, harriers, bald eagles, osprey, tree swallows, ruddy turnstones, black-bellied plovers, semi-palmated sandpipers, palm warblers, yellow-rumped warblers, cormorants, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, sanderlings, yellowlegs, oystercatchers, and pelicans all graced the island with their beauty and lifted the spirits of those few who opened their eyes to see it.

In the 7 river miles we traveled, we consistently saw Monarchs in the ones and  twos.  If I had to put a number on the total, it would be 100-200.   All were nectaring on the riverside flowers, none were engaging in directional flight.  I did not see any monarchs traveling to or from the river.<p>Over the past two weeks I have seen monarchs in and around Austin engaged in directional flight, but only one or two on any given day.<p>Away from the Cororado river, there are essentially no blooming flowewr.  Frostweed which is normally a migration staple around here are desiccated stalks with withered leaves and no flowers.  The white mistflower (another migration staple), in my yard, behaved abnormally this year.  The plants without irrigation bloomed in July, while the plants under irrigation are blooming now, their normal time.  Outside my yard, there are no white mistflowers blooming.<p>Much contrast between the verdant river edge and the desiccated upper bank.  Moving away from the river, it is just as brown or browner than in the photo.  The Colorado River in this section has a daily variation of about 18 inches as the River Authority releases water from the highland lakes for rice farmers along the coast.  Without the lake releases, the river flow here would be essentially zero except the effluent from Austin.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,200.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

They are being buried alive in the sand due to gale force winds for the last 3 days. We took no pictures.  It just was a difficult event to witness.  For the past 3 days we've been down on the beaches trying to relocate as many as we could to the back side of the dune, out of the wind.  The worst part is that many only ""look"" dead in the sand.  When you lift up the sand they start moving.  I went down to Ludington State Park this morning and walked about 1/2 mile down the beach and only found 3 today.  They were in good shape physically compared to the ones that we've been seeing. So put them in my pocket and walked them out to some beach grass away from the wind. The worst area in recent days was a remote beach called Magoon Creek Nature Area about 4 miles south of the city of Manistee city limits.  We rescued as many as we could on the beach itself, carrying them up the dune.  Then I realized that almost every other blade of beach grass had a monarch attached to it, totally battered, in most cases no wings, only the skeletal outlines of the wings, but still holding on for dear life.  Just awful, awful stuff. Honestly, the numbers are enormous, going on for miles and miles and miles. We've so enjoyed the huge numbers of Monarchs's here in Ludington all summer.  So this event is just so sad.  But glad we could let someone know what was/is going on.  Winds have died down temporarily for today only.

I had to penetrate the thickets and literally hand caught about 15 timing my grab with the wind bending the boughs down to me.

About 2PM, we went for a walk down the beach road, and the numbers were noticeably increasing. There were literally hundreds of Monarchs at a time heading west through the beach and dunes. There were large swarms at times, and it reminded us of the movie ""The Birds"". It was quite an impressive sight. I had heard about this happening in the past from my Aunt, We were amazed!! About five thirty or so, we were heading back and noticed that the Monarchs were settling down for the night on the trees. The trees were covered with groups from three to twenty at a time.

I watched as one of the monarchs I had tagged on Thursday lifted off and (with constant flapping) successfully made the crossing over the Chincoteague Channel. <p>Since this wind direction blows monarchs out to the ocean's edge, I headed out to the beach on Assateague and saw that monarchs were already migrating.  This was not a huge wave, but constant at about 2 monarchs per minute.  Most flew about 50-75 feet above the sand.  The wind speed was light enough so that the monarchs did not get blown out over the ocean.  As I have seen many times in the past, they were facing SW but being blown sideways while they flapped to stay true to their course.  The flight  pattern reminded me of that of a sharp-shinned hawk-- flap-flap-flap-glide, flap-flap-flap-glide.  So it wasn't the easy soaring flight the monarchs enjoy on a NE or N wind.  <p>There is some good news to report.  The wide expanses of open beach where the ocean breached the dune and overwashed into the cove are narrower this year.  (In past years, these areas were wide, barren areas with no wind buffer and monarchs got blown out to sea).   Last winter's storms must have deposited an unusually large amount of sand which has built up the existing dunes and created new ones.  Today the monarchs were flying over the narrow overwash areas without difficulty.  Even if the wind picks up speed, I think they will be able navigate these areas with some additional flapping.  <p>The bad news is that there were just as many monarchs heading north up the cove shoreline as there were monarchs heading south along the ocean shore.  So somewhere between me and the elbow of Tom's hook the monarchs were turning around.  The wind direction and speed would normally take them right off the island, but for some reason they were not leaving land.  The only thing I can think of is that they just didn't have enough fat reserves and they were back-tracking to look for nectar sources.  The problem is-- the seaside goldenrod is not in bloom yet.  The plants look stressed, with the bottom half of the stems' leaves brown and crispy.  The plants really need a good soaking rain to stimulate the flower buds to open. If the monarchs keep heading north about another half mile, they will find some groundsel-tree bushes to nectar on.  If the wind remains the same all day, there might be a roost near or in those bushes this evening.",Black hill visitor center,-999999.999,-999999.999,9902638,2.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

And like last August, it was difficult to find caterpillars (I didn't see any).  Thus at this point it appears the overwintering population in Mexico could possibly lower than last winter. However, the summer monarch breeding populationin the huge region between Iowa and Texas and westward to the Rocky Mountains may to be higher (based on mid-late summer sighting reports to Journey North) this year and could potentiallyboost the numbers of fall migrants entering Texas and Mexico to levels near or above those seen last year.

They were flying from east to west and mostly solo. This is the first sign of the migration I have witnessed this season. The monarchs were flying with dragonflies and damselflies. I counted in upwards of over 1000 dragonflies, so the monarchs should hopefully be arriving shortly. More than half of the pinetrees in the area where the monarchs traditionally roost overnight were destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, so although food is abundant, not sure what will happen at nightfall.

Triggered the first noteable Monarch migration of the season at Monarch Landing (one mile east of Port Burwell-north coast, central basin-Lake Erie.). A fairly regular stream of Monarchs were pushed from the north and ended up below the cliff face, sheltered from the north wind and moving S-W along the north shore of Lake Erie. Ten minute counts, three times an hour averaged about a butterfly a minute, for about six hours so I estimated between 350 and 400 monarchs passed by Monarch Landing yesterday. Most of these did not stop ,andÂ  these numbers, are very light for these dates and weather conditions (based on 16 years of counting at this location).  However considering Monarch numbers over the season it is at least a flow heading to Mexico. <P>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Today (7 Sept.), with S-W breezes off the lake, Monarchs were above the cliff and more likely to stop to nectar on the goldenrod and liatris.

Hundreds of monarchs feeding on Monarda citriodora, common name Lemon Mint. Monarda citriodora is not native to Illinois or Iowa, but is a prairie plant of Missouri, Nebraska, and elsewhere in parts of the south.<p> It was thrilling to be there at this impressive event first hand.Monarch event location is central Iowa, 55 miles west of Iowa City and 65 miles east of Des Moines.The Prairie Map lists exact location of Broad View Garden: http://prairiemap.com/Broad View Garden is 5 miles NW of Brooklyn and 15 miles east of Grinnell, Iowa.<p>The CRP field is 20 acres.  This entire field had blooming Lemon Mint.  I focused on the edge of the field near to the farm pond's Broad View Garden Area.  Thus, in saying hundreds, I have little accuracy in surmising the number across the entire field.  The greatest concentration appeared in the CRP field near the edge of the pine trees lining the pond.  Maybe, five hundred all total across the CRP field.  In evening they all flew into the maple and pine trees at the pond.  However, they flew in so staggered, again it is difficult to estimate the numbers.<p>  This CRP field was planted May 20th and had been mowed about six times to keep the weeds down and give the prairie plants a chance to become established.  Therefore, only when we stopped mowing in late summer did the Lemon Mint get going enough to produce blooms.  As a result, the Lemon Mint was in the peak of blooming when Monarchs gathered October 10th.  There appeared an increase in Monarchs sited at the CRP in the days leading up to October 10th.  I do not know if each day those Monarchs left and new Monarchs arrived, or if Monarchs arrived over several days--staying to feed and building up in large numbers--but, the large group of October 10th had left by October 11th.<p>  The next day, October 11th, I only saw two Monarchs.  Yesterday (October 14), I looked over the area and again only saw two Monarchs.<p>  Over this past summer, the Garden with prairie forbs has four to six Monarchs observed every day.  The farm has about 110 acres in CRP and most of that is in native plantings, although the forbs are few in most of the fields.  However, there is scattered common milkweed here and there on the farm.<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5dJGku1szk&amp;feature=youtu.be",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,500.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

Earlier in the year we scouted areas to look for monarchs on their migration or during the winter. Now it was time to see if they were there - or not. About two weeks earlier Keith Graves spotted about sixty monarchs near Lake Havasu. But this area was unexplored. A few hours after we set up camp, we walked along the Colorado as the sun was lowering. It didn't take too long to find them! Monarchs were flying high above the tree tops of three massive Willow Acacia trees, Acacia salicina, in bloom nestled together a short distance from the shore on a peninsula. The trees were huge, over 35 feet tall and the monarchs favored the top branches for the night. We needed binoculars to confirm they were monarchs in the dimming light and took photos. The queen butterflies congregated about half way up the trees and were easier to see. We even saw a small number of painted ladies in proximity to each other for the night. Each morning and evening we watched. In the morning they nectared on the Acacia flowers and by 10 a.m. a few would dip down to sip the morning dew in a nearby thatch of grass. We tagged a few and their abdomens were plump. By 10:30 each morning at least 20 to 25 began flying south along the river and more would arrive during the day. Out of the 150 or more monarchs we saw over 3 days we only saw two males exhibiting territorial behavior. No mating was seen. A park volunteer said this was the largest number of monarchs he has seen at the park in six years. He also said the Acacia trees were blooming a few weeks earlier than usual this year. A true ""Bed &amp; Breakfast"" break on their journey. We were glued to the trees - quite a glorious event to  ",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2013/1384295108.jpg,9938243,100.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

We parked in the roadside parking area and started our walk back to the pond. It was a beautiful and sunny late summer afternoon, the temperature hovered around 68 degrees and there was a mild breeze from the SW at about 10-15 MPH.  Our visit lasted from about 4:00 - 6:00 pm.  <p>Waterman Prairie at this location is in the Little Sioux River Valley and consists of rolling hills, valleys, and river overlooks now covered in prairie grasses and flowers.  There is a lot of big bluestem, maximillian sunflower, goldenrod, coneflowers, and numerous other prairie plants.  A small portion of the preserve is leased to an area farmer, so intermixed amongst the prairie grasses are smaller plots of corn, sunflowers, and alfalfa.  The farmer gets to harvest these plots but must leave a certain percentage of the crop stand through the winter as food plots for the wildlife.  <p>We started our hike down the path bordered on one side by mostly big bluestem and on the other side a corn plot backed by a sunflower plot. We were happy to see a few Monarchs flying here, perhaps 2 or 3 every 10 feet or so.  After a short walk we left the standing corn and entered a field (photo) of approximately 30-40 acres that at one time may have been a hayfield but looks now like it has been seeded with a prairie/wildflower mix and is in its second or third year since established.  There are a lot more prairie flowers here along with a good stand of red clover.  This is where we encountered the mass of Monarchs. <p> As we walked across this field they would just rise up in a cloud - magical.  About the only way I can describe it is like being in a Butterfly House say at an arboretum where the butterflies are flying all around you, only this was an open air one.  Hard to place a number on how many were in the field but it was the same concentration across the entire field.  If you would stand and turn in a circle there would probably be 20-30 you could count in a 50 foot radius.  And there were   probably two to three times that feeding on the flowers.  It appeared they especially liked the red clover.  <B>There were easily thousands, perhaps 10's of thousand of Monarchs in that field</B> and they appeared to mainly feeding rather than passing through.  <p>I did return on the following Sunday, September 21, 2014. The weather and time was similiar to my first visit except the wind was out of the north.  While their were a few butterflys in the fields this time, no Monarchs were seen.

After sitting and greeting friends, I started to notice more of them. Some coming from the direction of the ocean and others coming from the east. All heading west and flying  low over the dunes. Some were traveling alone and others in groups of up to five or six. I was thrilled to see them. It seems that I was the only one who noticed them. I did make sure that others knew they were there. I even spoke to a beach employee asking if he had noticed the migration during the past week. He had no idea but said that he would be looking in the future. I walked the beach heading west staying close to the dunes and sure enough there they were beautiful big colorful monarchs some resting and others in the air. Not really just how many I saw because I lost count. Last year on Fire island during migration only saw about seven. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9978328,100.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

It might have been 100, but as the last group of 5 could have been reported twice, I discounted the additional number.  The flow was steady for about an hour then tapered off as the temperature lowered.  The gap in the mountain ridge was much wider than we could cover, and likely many other Monarchs crossed that were not counted.This was the first time we ever observed the Monarch migration, and with me were my wife, a son and daughter-in-law and their three children, and two adult friends. The sky was mostly overcast and a rain front is supposed to be moving in tonight.  At Cherry Gap Overlook a sign is posted that discusses the Monarch migration and how the location is a good one for observation. We drove up last weekend and saw none, but today it was amazing.  The butterflies in the photograph performed something of a dance together in the air, and someone said they were mating.  I had mistakenly expected I could get some close-up photos, and since we had planned to bike ride, I had left my telephoto lens at home to save weight.

I don't know how many I saw fly past, but <B>if I had to guess I would say it was 3,000 - 4,000 monarchs</B>. And those are the ones who were migrating at a level that could be seen with the naked eye.  There may have been many more soaring higher, visible only in a binocular view. If you look at the data page for the Cape May Monarch Monitoring Project, you will see that they had an increase in monarch numbers on their road censuses today. But that doesn't tell the whole story. I spent the day observing from along the primary dune where most of the monarchs were migrating. <B>It was probably one of the best migration days I have seen in a long time. Monarch flight was constant but every now and then there would be a spurt of hundreds of monarchs all at once. At one point I counted monarchs for one minute and my total was 79.</B> It wasn't the frenzied flight of Monday; it was more of a lazy, relaxed flight. The wind was NE most of the day between 4-6 mph, so they didn't have to flap much.  Monarchs were swirling around each other quite a bit, usually with 3-5 individuals, but one spiraling group had 12 monarchs in it.  They were also landing frequently to nectar on seaside goldenrod on the dune. Many monarchs were making a detour at Cape May point State Park to visit the butterfly garden. New England aster and Zinnias were the most popular flowers. This provided a photo op for the many photographers and it attracted quite a crowd of curious onlookers.Tuesday afternoon around 3pm, I checked the boardwalk ramps that cross over the heavily vegetated primary dune at Cape May Point.  At the top of each crossover, there is a platform with seating around the sides, and in the middle there is a large round picnic table bolted to the deck. At the St. Peter&rsquo;s Church crossover, I put my folding chair on top of the table so that I had a high view of the surrounding vegetation and beach. I settled into the Zen of monarch-watching. The scene was mesmerizing, with a ceaseless flow of monarchs floating by me at eye level. This is just about the most southern point of the cape, so I assumed it would be the &ldquo;jumping-off&rdquo; spot for monarchs to cross over the Delaware Bay. (To see the platform location, see Google Earth image of South Lake Dr. and Ocean Ave at Cape May Point NJ).  They did in fact fly up to where the waves were crashing on shore, and made an abrupt stop and turnaround, and then continued along the dune.  It was a clear day, and with just my eyes, I could plainly see the enormous blades of the windmill on the shore at Lewes DE, as well as land on the horizon. But I guess it was too far and too late in the day for the monarchs to cross. I sat there until 5pm, when I noticed that monarchs were coming down&mdash;not to nectar but to perch in the pines, red-cedars, and wild black cherry trees on the dune. I watched until 5:30, and still no collective roosts were forming&mdash;only individual monarchs perching wherever they happened to be when it was time to land&mdash;with no time or energy spent on searching for other roosting monarchs. The wind was still favorable for migration&mdash;NE about 5mph, and some monarchs were still on the move.  They continued around the point and up the western side of the Cape. I later checked other public access locations up there, but never found a roost.  I searched until it was too dark to see. While I was perched on my table pedestal, I had many wonderful conversations with others who came to watch this migration spectacle. Several people stayed until I left.  There were so many good questions, and so many facial expressions of awe (my favorite part).  The sharing of monarch stories and experiences was illuminating. Two women, both in their 80&rsquo;s, who were there for a religious retreat, thanked me for bringing meaning to their visit. It got me thinking&mdash;with such a perfect and accessible location, it seems to me that the state park and the CMBO are missing a perfect opportunity to educate people. There should be a volunteer at every crossover platform on days with good migration winds and flows of monarchs to focus people&rsquo;s attention and answer questions.  Most people I met referred to the monarchs just as butterflies (didn&rsquo;t know their name) and were clueless about what was occurring. A lack of interpretation at these locations is criminal. I will contact the two organizations and make suggestions.It's important to note that my counts were unofficial.

I put my hummer feeders out by the milkweed as I had one smarty a couple weeks ago, figure out how to nectar on the feeder.       I did capture and release one tagged, male Monarch today in the garden.   Tag number:  TJX 927.    Would this be the place to report this number and have it on record??    Thanks!

Hopefully, he'll make it to Mexico intact and help spawn (to use a fish term) the next generation.  Go Monarchs! October 8 updateIncidentally, I saw the tagged butterfly 3 days in a row in my garden. So it migrated in from somewhere, and stuck around for at least that long. For all I know, it could still be out there as there are approximately 150-200 Monarchs in my yard right now. So finding it is hit or miss. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/10/1412522933.jpg,9946019,150.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

I tagged a total of 56 this year, 28 wild and 28 reared by myself or my neighbor. What are the odds of that!? Wild were 8F and 20M, reared were 19F and 9Mâ€¦which I guess proved that guys ARE wilder! The reared ones were emerging in ""waves"", probably due to us collecting them as eggs or small larva from our garden milkweed plantsâ€¦ based on tagging data starting 8/15, butterfly baby booms were 8/14-16, 9/3-5, and 9/18-19. Another noteâ€¦ A neighbor child reported seeing some monarchs in her tree on Sept. 13. I didn't see them myself, so didn't report as a roostâ€¦I scoured the area and didn't see them, only had a couple at my butterfly bushes and tagged them. It was VERY windy that day and they may have traveled across Lake Erie and taken a quick rest before heading on. It was encouraging this year compared to last year when I was only able to tag 12 wild and was not able to find ANY eggs or caterpillars to raise. I hope the trend continues and we have more next year. I have some leftover tags (about 40) - if anyone in the southern states is in need, I can mail them to you if you send me an email. Thanks!

No successful directional flight.  Any that went high were blown north rapidly.  A few seemed to work south using trees and shrubs as windbreaks, but mad elittle progress. .<p>I&rsquo;m entering this as peak migration because of numbers, but this is likely not the actual peak, which has occurred in the Oct 11 to Oct 18 window in past years.  And JN reports show many still further north.  Note that this count is at least partly additive to the roost repot for the same day.  <p>Monarchs on every liatris patch I checked, plus several other flower types.  I saw about 250 directly.  Density varied too much for me to do an estimate based on known area of liatris.  But I would be uncomfortable estimating twice the direct count.  <p>Direct counting is more challenging than usual this year.  Liatris emerges in the spring, but doesn&rsquo;t bloom until mid-Sep through Oct.  Stalks stay 12-18 inches most of the year, but grow taller if moisture is available in September.  This year September was dry, so many are relatively short.  On the other hand we got huge rain in June and above average in July, which is ideal timing for Prairie grasses, so grasses have grown as uniformly tall as I can recall.  The shortest species, Little Bluestem is 3-4 feet tall.  So Liatris, and Monarchs on it, are concealed.  <p>The first picture is shows of the tougher examples.  Monarch on Liatris in Little Bluestem.  It&rsquo;s not the toughest case of course, since the sun is lighting his wings.  The second picture is a liatris patch that happens to be in the open, and apparently has local soil moisture.  Even this is not too easy to count.  A few Monarchs are clearly visible.  But close inspection shows at least 15, most in shadow or partly hidden.

The others were feeding primarily on the candlestick plants, Santa Barbara Salvia and the Pavonia. A smaller number were on the lantana and milkweed. The weather was sunny and about 85 F, with a breeze of about 10mph.

It didn&rsquo;t until about 17:00 when it slowed but remained at least 1 per minute.  Last sighting at 19:05, which is 10 minutes after end of local sunset.<p>The easily observed view for counting was about 100 yards wide.  In addition to those passing in this width, I checked with binoculars at right angles to their direction of travel.  Visibility of ground level reaches 500 yards one direction and 200 the other.  I saw monarchs traveling in parallel paths across the whole span.  <p> To get an estimated count I used the initial rate from actually counting until 17:00, then cut in the rate in half until sunset.  I did NOT scale up for those passing in the distance to either side, nor for any earlier 12:45.<p>All were flying generally south.  Clearly directional flight.  Occasionally some stopped at flowers for a few seconds, but no lingering.  Never saw one fly into trees, but rather went over or around.  In spite of prevailing crosswind to somewhat opposing wind, all traveled quickly.  Wind pattern around trees and terrain apparently provided some useful local tail wind. All were flying individually, well spaced.  Any groups of 2 or 3 were coincidental, and quickly separated as they continued.  There was absolutely no suggestion of &ldquo;flocking&rdquo; or flying in formation.  No reaction between individuals short of a random near collision.<p>Individual flight was a bit of everything.  Some flapping, some gliding.  Most were fairly low, but some at 50 feet or more.  I even followed a couple with binoculars that appeared to be trying to ride small thermals upward, circling and rising.<p>All in all undramatic.  No great activity or numbers all at once.  No roosting, no gathering on food sources, just slow continuous flow, one at a time.  We could easily not have noticed. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,6724,700.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

There were many more monarchs nectaring in the fields and we probably could have tagged at least another 100.  <p>I would have to estimate the number to be over 250.  Usually we start at one end of the field, walk to the other end, turn around and walk back.  Then we would turn around and repeat the process because new monarchs are always flying in.  In past years we would eventually move to a new field because there weren't any around after three or four trips through the field.  This year we go through the field once and we were done with our 100 tags.  At times I was walking around with four butterflies in my net because there were so many around that I didn't want to stop to tag them.  Last year we only had 50 tags.  It took us two days and about seven hours to use them up.  Many more monarchs this year.  <p>I don't know if the monarchs arrived on that day.

We observed that the monarchs were coming EAST off the lake and heading due West. They were flying high from 50 to 200 feet as they came off the lake. We could see them quite far out as they approached. Instead of landing on the beach as they usually do, they just kept on going west with fast and steady wing beats.&nbsp;The monarchs did this for most of the 10 hour count. Inland, the wind was NW at 7 mph, but it was northeast off the lake at 10-14 mph.We believe that the monarchs actually crossed Lake Huron from Canada. If they came from the Bruce Peninsula area of Canada, directly due east of us, it would take at least 6 hours to cross on a good&nbsp;NE&nbsp;wind on steady wing beats.&nbsp;Alternatively, maybe they had been blown over the lake from somewhere to our north and were working their way inland. The&nbsp;northeast winds may have been hitting the northwest wind near the beach, so maybe the monarchs were flying from the north and got pushed out over the lake and then pushed back to land coming from the east.Temperature at the start of the count was 57F. with a high of 64F. It was 59F. at the end of count. Very fluffy clouds, but plenty of sunshine.

They also like the flowers which, this time of year include lots of goldenrod, some purple asters, lavender thistles. Earlier flowers -- before the autumn monarch migration, flower included black-eyed susans, purple coneflower, and quite a bit of milkweed. Ah, milkweed -- where we found monarch caterpillars--but not nearly as many as are included in the south-bound migration we're witnessing.I took this photo facing north, monarchs above the goldenrod.

On White Lake Wildlife Management Area, near Dyersburg TN, a friend and I searched two fields dominated by Pennsylvania smartweed.  One field about 30 acres, the other smaller, 15 - 20 acres.  Each field bordered on two sides by black willows.  Early, monarchs were flying from willows to smartweed.  The count of 373 is conservative.  We tagged 100 monarchs and feel sure that there were at least 5 or 6 untagged for each one we tagged.  Also, another nearby large field of smartweed was inaccessible and probably had many more monarchs.

89468,1445199858,2015-10-18,Monarch PEAK Migration,100,30.449,-86.626,0,"We spent the morning at Beasley State Park on the beach (on the Gulf of Mexico) on Okaloosa Island. There were Gulf Fritillaries and Monarchs and Buckeyes every where! The Fritillaries are in their peak migration to the Florida peninsula and the Monarchs are in their peak migration to Mexico, so they are both all over the beaches. They were all feeding on several species of yellow asters and wild lantana. The Monarchs in the dunes seemed mostly intent on feeding, others on the beach were mostly flitting towards the west and out over the Gulf. It was sunny, temps in the high sixties and there was a strong northeasterly wind, approximately ten to twelve mph which was making it easy for the Monarchs but difficult for the Fritillaries. It was quite exhilarating to see all of the many butterflies! <p> They (monarchs and fritillaries) were out flying everywhere along Hwy 98 (which follows the beach for about two miles), the areas between the highway and the dunes, the dunes (which have various species of yellow asters which they flock to) and the beach. All up and down the strip.  I am sure there were much more than 100 in that distance. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have a camera with me.  But this phenomenon is still taking place, so I guess I should head back out to the beach and take a few shots. I was only there for about fifteen minutes with my husband. We went specifically to check them out. I wanted to show him up close. I have been going there frequently for the past two weeks to watch the hundreds and hundreds of fritillaries that migrate through (incidentally, this visit was the first time I saw any monarchs there).  That in itself is an exciting spectacle to see. On some days you can stand at the edge of the dunes and watch them fly right by you in groups of twenty to thirty, one group after the other.  Of course, each year they are migrating east to the peninsula of Florida (I am located in the panhandle of Fla.) so most of them follow the beach. During this visit, you could see the fritillaries heading east and the monarchs attempting to head west (the east wind was making it difficult for them, though). We have a pavilion and boardwalk down to the beach. Between the pavilion and the dunes on the beach, there is a closed in stretch which is filled with these flowering plants that the different species of butterflies all flock to for nectaring. Relating to your last question, just right in this small area, I would say it was about equal numbers feeding, flitting around and flying westerly.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9956509,100.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

A group of roosting Monarchs in south Midland County was estimated to contain 20,000-25,000 individuals. Several experienced butterfly counters observed this concentration. The Monarchs were watched as they took off in great clouds when the temperature warmed. We have seen flocks of Monarchs in the sky passing overhead and large clusters of Monarchs hanging from trees in the evening. Many Monarchs have also been seen in Lubbock and even Amarillo which is unusual. The primary Monarch route--usually through Central Texas--shifted westward this year, probably due to the drought in Central Texas and the abundant rains in late September in West Texas.

90356,1446392970,2015-10-31,Monarch PEAK Migration,200,30.23,-97.714,0," I saw hundreds on Monarchs in Austin.  Surprising!  I saw more monarchs in 30 minutes than Iâ€™ve seen all year.  Bright, fresh, long winged migrating monarchs of both sexes.  Weâ€™ve had a couple rainy days with strong winds out of the south, so I should not be surprised to see Monarchs that had hunkered down.  They were sunning themselves and nectaring on evergreen sumac blooms which were plentiful and covered with numerous other insects. (sunny temp  65df)  The preserve manager said they had been there the day before as well.Hereâ€™s the funny thing, I went a quarter mile away to another nature preserve with similar vegetation, and there were none.  I saw none on the rest of the day even though I was outside observant, and I drove up and down all over Austin including over several really tall overpasses where I sometimes get up into migrating monarchs.So my question: I know many butterflies â€œhill topâ€ as a means of coming together and facilitating meeting mates.  The preserve where I saw the monarchs is among the tallest in a hilly area.  Locally known as lone tree hill. Are monarchs known to hill top?  It does not really make sense?  Years ago, I saw roosts in the Kerrville area the morning after a strong cold front (similar conditions) which were down in a valley along a creek.  That location to emerge after hunkering down makes a lot more sense.  The mystery continues.<p>Courtesy of Monarch Watch<p>Editorâ€™s note: Based on the comment of â€œhundredsâ€ we are estimating 200 monarchs.

Suddenly we saw wave after wave of Monarchs coming along the lake shore heading westward. This continued for at least one hour. Our patio is on a small bluff perhaps 20 feet above the lake level. They were typically above us but many flew right by us at our level. Mainly along the lakeshore but some were actually over the water. There were successive waves. At the peak I estimate at least 100 per minute slowing as the time progressed. It was one of the most amazing things we have ever seen. A few stopped momentarily on flowers, but they were mainly busily migrating, not stopping to feed.The entire event was actually at least two solid hours. At first there were a few in the flowers and I thought that was nice since we have not seen many in the last few years. Then I noticed they were fluttering by the window facing the lake, so I went outside and saw they were coming in a swath roughly from the east along the lake shore and headed roughly west. We live about two miles west of Vermilion Ohio on the lake front. The peak hour was the second hour, and I would estimate the peak truly was a 100 or so in a one, maybe two minute period. Hard to say for sure, but I was so stunned. In the middle of the peak I could look up, to the lake, back south to the landward side, or, best of all, some went along side me or right over my head! You could see them materialize as they headed towards us and then they were past and gone. Some were very deliberate in moving on, some were playing a bit, and some stopped on some of the flowering plants but did not stay long on them. I think I must have had a very foolish grin on my face because watching them just made me want to laugh!&nbsp;Some were every high in the air. As high as some very large old maples that we have in our area. Others were below the level of our patio, slightly. Our patio is about 20 feet above lake level where we are. Most were at our level or somewhat above, maybe up to 20-30 feet above our patio level.&nbsp;Prior to the peak I would estimate they started passing 10 or so per minute when I really knew something was starting to happen, then ramped up from that to the peak and then ramped down. Even after it was 'over' every now and again a straggler would fly by, but if I had not seen the main event I never would have thought it was part of a migration.&nbsp;I would say the 'peak' period was a good solid 10 minutes with fall off on both sides. So I would have estimated 10 minutes @ 100/minute = 1,000 monarchs. Yes, there were that many! You could smooth the before and after to follow the shape of your curve, and I think you would have it. Interestingly, when we see the duck migrations, they are almost all in giant flocks during the 'peak', with very few before and after.&nbsp; The Monarchs are a bit more 'mercurial' in their behavior, but the so called peak was flockish as well.It had been a rainy afternoon, but when&nbsp;the migration event&nbsp;happened the skies had cleared, and the winds were calm, maybe 5mph or so off the lake. Pleasant temperature, maybe 75F or so.&nbsp;I did not get any pictures sorry to say. They were spread out enough it would have been hard to do it justice, and I did not want to miss any of it. But here is a picture (taken in the spring). I was standing on the grass and the Monarchs were coming toward me. I was facing NE and they first became visible at about the treeline over the beach.We used to have more milkweed in our area than we do today, but I did notice a few plants coming back, so I am glad about that. But, they must have already fed for the day since they were mainly moving past our area.&nbsp;",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2016/09/1473778683.jpg,9995855,1000.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

A few stopped to feed from flowers.        Started timed counts from back porch with Monarchs flying across or away. at 1345.  Observation view about 70 yards.  99 in 90 minutes.  Stopped briefly then 52 in 20 minutes.  Total 151 in 110 minutes = 82 per hour.  No more timed counts but still flying at 1730.    6 hours at 82 per  hour is 492.  Reported total includes a few more I saw feeding while on the way to check roosts later.Speculation I could have assumed that the stream was wider than 70 yards, which is not unreasonable since there is no obvious reason they would be strongly channeled by terrain.  If anything I would expect terrain to channel them away.  If I scaled up for a wider width, I could get 5000 just on our property by assuming they were crossing the open meadows east and west of our house.

Beginning at around 11:00 I was noticing one Monarch every couple of minutes.  Around 13:00 we headed toward the tip in hopes of seeing them flying out across Lake Erie.  After getting off the tip shuttle, we took the footpath toward the tip and were still seeing monarchs flying South at the rate of around one per minute. There was a strong wind from the West.  When we reached the tip we noticed them trying to fly out across Lake Erie.  As they left the shelter of land the wind immediately pushed them East.  We watched many struggle against the wind and eventually make their way back to the shelter of the trees on the East Beach in the lee of the wind.  They were not clustering. Many were resting only a metre or two above the sand on Wild Grape, Mulberry and other vegetation.  There was a lot of activity in the lee of the wind. Dozens and dozens of Swallows, Red-winged Blackbirds and dragonflies of various types were chasing swarms of insects and disturbing the resting Monarchs.  Many visitors were able to get close up pictures of the resting Monarchs. Of the ones we were able to identify, the vast majority were male. Temperature was around 24&deg;C, mostly sunny.   The irony of the day is that while we were watching many fly South, we also witnessed at least one female ovipositing on the tiny Milkweed plants growing in the sand at Northwest Beach.  It was quite a thrill for the Junior Naturalists who got to see it happen.  We found two second instar caterpillars as well.

Some would trail in by 2's, 3's and occasionally 4's. Initially they appeared to be heading westward along this Lake Ontario beach and some make a right turn to drop into the garden, while later in the day they appeared to be arriving from the north. By about 2 pm, the migration slowed right down. Very flighty, easily disturbed and some would take took off if they detected any movement.

The 101 were captured in about 3.5 hours.Nights will continue to be cool, with radio reports predicting Toronto temperatures from 5 C to 8 tonight. Days will continue to warm up during the next three days.Dropped into an agricultural field to the east of this location with many tender milkweeds that emerged after a mowing.

The weather was quite a bit cooler up til then. September 26: I went back to the park today and it seems most of the butterflies have headed south.

Then in early to mid-September, with asters and goldenrods blooming in profusion, the winds have been blowing strong southwest to northeast off and on for weeks, and monarch movement seemed to be halted. A few monarchs moved through from time to time but not what I had been expecting based on the summerâ€™s activity.Then on a lovely Sunday, October 1, the monarchs and painted ladies filled the New England asters (Symphotrichum novae-angliae) in my way station 8 max. at a time (monarchs) 24 (painted ladies) on the New England asters and I thought that might be it for major movement for the season. I felt lucky and glad that the asters and goldenrods were still in bloom for these last monarchs of the season.But yesterday, October 10, brought a glorious day full of a new flood of freshly colored monarchs, gliding down the road and over the causeway, and filling my yard throughout the day -18 max. at one time - on the small white asters (S. ericoides and pilosum mostly) which are the only native nectar plants fully in bloom right now. A stunning and beautiful day with the air full of monarchs everywhere. There is still a little seaside goldenrod, late blue aster (S. patens), and small white asters in bloom for nectaring, but plants are going by quickly now.Winds are forecast to be favorable for the next few days - blowing out of the north and northeast.

I kept searching for roosts without success but they were in the park I just couldn't locate them. The monarchs were in the patch by 9 am were still nectaring at sunset. The number of monarchs is so hard to estimate. Once it really got started on Thursday morning (10/12) the primary flower patch I have been watching, and a smaller one nearby, have been non-stop with at least 30 or so monarchs at any one time all day long.

It didn't occur to me to get photos, plus I don't usually carry my camera or phone on the beach.  But we were positive that they were monarchs.  I found one dead one on the beach and it was definitely a monarch - you can't mistake the size or pattern. I was surprised at how many there were traveling down the coast.  We watched one monarch land in the sand in front of our chairs, rest for about 5 minutes, then take off straight out into the Gulf.  We followed it with our eyes as long as we could.....just fascinating.  ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,10005305,50.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

With the approaching rain and intensifying wind off the Long Island Sound, activity decreased.Also, two exhausted Monarch Butterflies (based on their wing contours) were observed as they appeared to comfort each other waiting to die (each had a leg joined together while their lower bodies underneath their wings were also touching).    Both were resting on a flower but too exhausted to eat its nectar (based on the fact their tongues were not extended into the flower and neither made an effort to gather nectar for some 20 minutes).  Both remained stationary and only moved slightly when I lightly touched them to see if they were alive.

But this morning when I saw a monarch feeding on pansies at the North Carolina Arboretum I thought, maybe not.  So, being fairly close already, I drove up the Blue Ridge Parkway to Cherry Gap Overlook (4327 feet elevation), a historically reliable place for monarchs to cross the high ridges.  Arrived at 12:18 pm and right away saw four monarchs floating overhead in a line.  It was partly cloudy, with a airflow from the west, but with southerly breezes at ground level, until later when it was calm.  Some of the earlier monarchs had to fight their way over, and one or two got pushed back or sideways until they eventually made it.  The temperature ranged from between 60 and 70 degrees F.  It was exciting to see the butterflies this late in the year, the so-called Day of the Dead when the first ones are supposed to arrive in the mountains in Mexico.  Once these butterflies reach the lowlands of South Carolina, they will have a better chance of making it all the way, provided they can find food sources.

The sky was mostly sunny and temps between 39-50.  Light breeze from w-sw.  I saw my first flying Monarch about 1115 am and the temperature on my car thermometer was 39!  I saw four others flying low or landing along field edges before I got to the Cable Mill area.  I was at Cable Mill from 1130-1350. The fields around the Cable Mill area in Cades Cove were all mowed in August and used for parking or program site for the eclipse.  Most of the grass is fescue with some red clover but I didn't find any clover with flowers.  I saw a number land in grass or on leaves but observed no flowering plants since we have had a few frosts in Cades Cove.  I later went to Sparks Lane where we have tagged many Monarchs and saw only one there in about 15 minutes and it was quite high.  These fields had not been mowed. The Monarchs were all flying in a general westerly direction.  Most were 3-10' above the ground but some were above treetops and a few very high and difficult to see without binoculars. At times I could see 6-8 within 100 yards of where I was helping with a sorghum demonstration. The elevation in Cades Cove is about 1,800 feet. Once the Monarchs passed by/over Cable Mill they had many miles to fly over forests in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Cherokee National Forest.  Sunday was very overcast and I did not go into the park.  I will go again tomorrow and will report if I see any more.

On 11/2 I was up on the Foothills Parkway and saw 3 Monarchs flying at about 3,000 feet elevation - it was sunny and about 60 degrees.Capturing and tagging Monarchs in the Cable Mill area allowed me to talk with over 100 people about Monarchs and their migration to Mexico.

Today the skies were cloudy, temp 70 F with light North-East Wind. The conditions today were excellent for focusing the butterflies to travel along the Lake Erie shoreline in a SW direction.  There were so many butterflies it was almost impossible to count them. There were some butterflies dropping to the ground looking for nectar but the vast majority where gliding on the wind well above tree height. Many were up 2 or 3 times tree height &ndash; and many more were much higher, gliding on the wind. At one point, there were so many the sky was a black cloud of butterflies against a cloudy-sky background. I conservatively estimate 10-15 thousand per hour passing through from 12:00 noon until 5:00 PM. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have my camera with me. If we have a repeat of weather conditions in the next few days with a northeast wind (the key factor) I&rsquo;ll be sure to have my camera.When the wind is from the north east it forces the butterflies to fly along the shore-line which concentrates them in large numbers. This is a pattern I have seen in previous years which is why Clearville Park is a good place to see the migration provided the wind cooperates.  They don&rsquo;t like to go over water unless they have to. They prefer to fly in a south- west direction because if you continue in that direction it will take you to Mexico. September 10 addition: Pt. Pelee is 50 miles due south-west of Clearville Park on the Lake Erie shore so is in the direction that the butterflies are flying. Pt. Pelee is the southernmost tip of Canada and is a National Park. Monarchs form large roosts there waiting for weather conditions to take them across the lake to Ohio.  Because of the number of butterflies that we witnessed on Friday (9/7) at Clearville Park they should start showing up in large numbers at Pt. Pelee in a few days. It will take a few days because the weather after our sighting on Friday has been dominated by the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon with very strong 40 MPH east winds so it is unlikely that they would make any progress in such poor conditions. The weather conditions are expected to improve tomorrow (9/11).   ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9941930,50000.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

I went to the house to grab my binoculars to attempt to identify the birds.  I thought I was seeing leaves blowing through my binoculars. I was seeing literally thousands of monarchs riding the winds of a cold front moving through. The majority were gliding in the wind, expending little to no energy. Coming from the northeast to a southwest direction. It&rsquo;s 5:00 p.m. and some seem to be coming to the ground as I write this.  We shall see if they roost here tonight. This is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen!!!!I'm estimating I have been watching for over an hour. My estimate is nowhere scientific. Everywhere I looked with my binoculars, I could see monarchs....not one here and one there, 3-12 in my binocular focal point. Continuous. I live on a high hill, with 360 view. I literally thought they were leaves blowing.No pics of the monarchs. That would be impossible because 99.9% were not able to be seen with the naked eye. They were very much aloft. But somewhere this evening southwest of me, there will be an amazing roost!What prompted me to go into the house for my binoculars where hundreds of swallows that were dive bombing my freshly mowed alfalfa. There were many turkey buzzards and unknown raptors aloft which I assume were following the swallows.The sky was partially cloudy, with clouds that are on the leading edge of a storm. I'm estimating the wind to be 13 mph from the northeast with gusts to 20 mph.This sighting for me was a very enlightening experience. I learned that monarchs and birds will utilize the leading edge of a front to boost them for many miles - speeding travel and conserving energy.Editor's Note: The observer&rsquo;s effort to estimate the number of monarchs in a one-hour continuous flow seems reasonable. The 10,000 per hour estimate would break down to roughly 3 monarchs per second. Here&rsquo;s the math: 3 monarchs/second X 60 seconds/minute X 60 minutes/hour = 10,800 monarchs per hour.

Just before 14:00 we started to notice them flying in a definite Southwest direction. They seemed to be descending as they approached the marsh/wetland abutting Lake Erie. We observed them from the Hawk Tower using both our binoculars and the naked eye. They were flying singly at altitudes varying from two to three times tree height to just above the ground.   Using the binoculars we were able to observe that as they approached the lake's edge they seemed to hesitate and then disappear behind a mature Cottonwood on private property flying further west.  Around 15:15 we decided to head to the lake to see if we could see where they were headed. Some were crossing the lake! Using the binoculars I could see them flying Southwest into the wind flapping their wings constantly about a metre above the waves. In a ten minute period I saw 10 singles and one pair crossing and one heading back.   I watched until they disappeared out of my field of vision.

It is the most we have seen in years,it is wonderful to see.We are seeing at least 25 monarch per minute.We were watching for several hours, mainly after 1pm. This is the most we have seen in the last 5 years.Our home is situated on the slopes of Fox Mountain rising 2,000+ feet to our east, and the Shenandoah National Park, with Cedar Mountain rising 3,000+ feet to our west.  From our vantage point at 1,200 feet (in the five acre wooded meadow/pasture/garden I cleared in our 65-acre forest property), the Monarch fall migration pattern funnels between these two mountain ranges in the areas known locally as Blackwells Hollow and, further south, Brown's Cove.The peak migration Carmen and I observed on the afternoon of September 25 occurred as the weather finally cleared, right after days of rain, when (I assumed) Monarchs left their roosts en masse on their flight south.Carmen pointed out to me dozens that were flying so high, I would not otherwise have noticed them.  Another contingent were flying just above the tree tops.  And a third group were skimming above the pasture, pausing for refreshment on blooming golden rod and buddleias.As evening approached, I saw one or two Monarchs appear to settle in for the evening in the upper branches of a very tall White Pine.  The other taller trees comprising the forest in our neck of the woods are mostly Oak, Hickory, Ash, Sweet Birch, Black Gum, Black Cherry, and Tulip Poplar.  I have not seen any large congregations of Monarchs in our trees this year.

A windy cold front came through and so did a bunch of monarchs at high altitude with a few gliding lower. One folded its wings, dropped like a rock then double-backed to check out the flowers in the yard. While this was going on, I got 2 such visitors.In a nutshell, what happened during the course of the day is that a few monarchs had shown up to nectar in the morning and then seemed to have disappeared completely the nearer to noon it got. The wind started to pick up from the north about mid-afternoon, 3pm-ish, and that's when I started to monitor the skies overhead (I first witnessed this type of event last year and my hunch was based on last year's experience). The ones I could spot came at a rate of about 1 every couple minutes, but that accelerated to one every minute, and at peak it was one every 45 seconds-ish and their rate of travel had accelerated to the point of being too quick to allow my camera to focus. ""Flying as fast as the wind"" would be a literal accurate description. The number of minutes I watched were non-contiguous and I didn't keep track of exactly how many those were. I watched on and off from mid-afternoon til dusk, something like 7 or 7:30-ish pm.In the afternoon, after watching long enough to develop a bit of a crick in my neck, I went to my computer and posted notice of the event in progress in a Facebook Group called Oklahoma Friends of Monarchs, where reports elsewhere in Oklahoma of this event were posted and the Admin urged everyone to report those sightings to Journey North and I'm sure they did just that. It's worthwhile to mention again that the meteorologist at OKC TV station KFOR showed radar that detected the front which is supposed to detect just precipitation and he explained that the radar image wasn't precipitation but ""birds and bugs"". It's reasonable to infer that the monarch migration event did show up on weather radar. :)This picture is of the nectaring area in the front yard the morning of the same day the event occurred.",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526373755.jpg,9992798,20.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

It was very difficult to estimate the number of monarchs in the field since they were moving around and the field was very tall. Based on scanning the field and the number we tagged I would say 250-300+ and that is very conservative and likely much higher than that. Most of those monarchs headed to the roost. We counted 23 in 1 minute which continued for 15-20 minutes and likely longer so I would say 300-500 and probably much more than that.

166912,1526376887,2018-09-30,Monarch PEAK Migration,31,41.638,-70.904,1,"Hello all: The last three days here have seen the most visible monarch migration activity I have seen this year. One&rsquo;s and two&rsquo;s in a few small waves only, up til this past weekend where I had 11 monarchs drop in late in the day yesterday to nectar on the flowering asters and goldenrods in my yard (Waystation 04511). Four monarchs in my yard again as early as 8 am and more through out the day - three or four staying through the cloudy afternoon and the last one just leaving just as rain began for what I think must be a roosting area (heading northeast back to the forest and away from my yard) in the face of a strong south west wind. For the last three days monarchs have been coming early in the morning and leaving after an hour or so in a southwest direction - slipping up and over my neighbors house. Still others drop in throughout the day and stay until 5:30 and fly back in two the northeast.Today, while doing a botanical inventory in saltmarsh, and maritime shrub communities on West Island, I counted 22 monarchs in one hour nectaring on seaside goldenrod. Most were in the upper saltmarsh on the lee side of the wind but a few were on low plants out in the wind and hanging on. Interestingly, some the asters and goldenrods are either late to flower this year or staying in flower later. Not sure which. Usually I observe higher monarch numbers earlier, but often the New England asters (their asters of choice!) have gone by before the main wave of monarchs come by. This year NE asters are still in bloom at my way station in great profusion and there are still several other asters just beginning to flower.Also the seaside goldenrod is in full and early bloom here on October 1 - did everything flower late because of the drought? I don&rsquo;t know.The weather in September changed dramatically from hot (early) to cool and cloudy and I didn&rsquo;t observe any monarchs moving for days at a stretch. The last three days were sunny (if windy) and we have more warm temps promised for the end of the week after two days of rain. Hope the migration continues then. I do enjoy seeing the monarchs on the asters. You have to wait all year for goldenrods and asters to bloom but when they do they are much enjoyed by all sorts of insects and pollinators - especially the monarchs, who look like orange jewels hanging from the purple and yellow flowers. So beautiful.Louise BarteauWaystation 04511West Island, Buzzards BayFairhaven, MA",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/10/1526376887.jpg,9944685,31.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

Thousands and thousands of Monarchs filled the skies for a couple of hours before and after a front came through.  When the reports started being posted on our local FB group, it was storming and pouring at my house.  I made the decision to see if I could get away from the storm and catch the migration.  It&rsquo;s been hard hearing reports all around, including one report within 5 miles of my house, and not seeing anything!  I got in the car and drove west.  Within a few miles, I was out of the heavy downpour and the rain was falling lightly.  I started seeing Monarchs in front of me.  I pulled off the road and watched them.  I ended up driving down to Bixby which is a couple of miles south of where I was seeing the Monarchs, and ended up on a dead-end street.  The Monarchs were swirling above me and flying southwest.  There were hundreds.  I would calculate at least a thousand per minute.  They were flying overhead, they were descending and swirling, and they were everywhere! I stood there and watched them for 20 minutes with no breaks, just continuous monarchs coming overhead, some coming all the way down to the ground, and others as high as the eye could see.  It was truly amazing.  I estimate that there were more than 10,000 per hour crossing my location. There were Monarchs migrating across the entire metropolitan area of Tulsa, probably a 30 mile swath, and I saw a tiny fraction of them.  We have estimated hundreds of thousands flew over the area, possibly millions. I haven't seen anything like this since the 90s when we had the big migrations.Here is a photo taken by Kelly Bostian, Outdoor Editor of the Tulsa World.  It is taken from a video he made.

It's very hard to estimate the numbers even after years of reporting! Our driving census only counted 60 in 20 minutes but they couldn't see the monarchs, over the dune shrubs, along the goldenrod on the beach.  I drove from one end of town to the other and then out to Cape May Point.  The Goldenrod plants in the dunes on the beach front and at the Point had monarchs feeding on them.    They were covered as far as the eye could see.  And there was a steady stream all day.  Our team did find some roosts of a few hundred in various locations but some also stayed in the dunes. At sunset some monarchs were coming back in off the water, like they had tried to go across the Bay and then it got dark.  It was a warm evening, 60 degrees and getting warmer overnight.

First Presbyterian Church in Allen has spent several years installing and maintaining a large labyrinth garden which includes lots of native plants, and today, hundreds (maybe thousands) of Monarchs stopped by to use its nectar resources. I have not seen Monarchs this dense in Allen since 2005. It has been raining really hard for two days, with the sun finally emerging today. This morning, temps were in the low 60's, but by 2 pm this afternoon, they rose to the mid 70's with light winds.One concern: I noted that the ones I caught for tagging did not seem very fat. I fear that the bad weather has kept them from feeding for a few days.  Some also looked a bit travel-worn.Interestingly, my next stop (about two miles away) yielded exactly one Monarch. I went from the church garden to another garden designed as a Monarch Waystation. Unfortunately, some compromise substitutions had been made in the original plant list, and the garden looks great but isn't attracting nearly as many butterflies as the garden with the abundance of natives. The gardeners working with the second garden  will be adding more natives when they can. I watched one small butterfly land repeatedly on Zinnias with congested centers and give up without nectaring there. I had read that the more open forms have more readily accessible nectar, but this was the first time I have seen a living illustration of that principle.All-in-all, it was an amazing day to be a Monarch fan in Allen, TX.I would estimate there were between 500 and 1,000.

Looked up around 09:00 and started noticing Monarchs in directional flight Southwest coming across the harbour at heights from head height to tree top and above.  Rate was one per minute approximately. About an hour after the boats launched we headed to the Burlington side of the harbour to the Lasalle Park and Marina for a better view of the regatta on shore and I still noted Monarchs at the rate of one per minute. Flying height again varying from head height at harbour level to some flying above tree top level on the bluff above the harbour. Noticed three nectaring on flowers in the Lasalle Park on the bluff but all the rest were on the move.  A friend who was in the harbour on the race committee boat for the regatta noted many monarchs flying past him  in the middle of the harbour throughout the race.  Dinghys came in off the harbour around 16:30 and that is the last observation I made as I was busy hauling boats after that.  Using these observations I feel confident to note a migration rate through this area at one per minute minimum from 09:00 until 16:30 For a conservative total of 450.It was a beautiful late summer day, partly cloudy with temperatures ranging from approximately 17°C to 22°C.  Wind was variable at times but  according to the AccuWeather function on my phone  292.5° at 18 km/h at 16:15. The Monarchs were undeterred by the wind and at times seemed to be flying directly into it.  Counting was done by texting myself each time I saw one or more and by noting the time in the vehicle while driving. What a beautiful sight to witness.  Please note: I will make a separate observation to note the location of the Lasalle  Park but the numbers should not be counted twice.

They are all flying in the same direction - south west towards Pt Pellee (the southernmost geographic point in Canada).  This butterfly swarm continued for about three hours in the morning and tapered off to 350 per hour in the afternoon. Weather conditions ideal - sunny, 65- 70 F with little to no wind. Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingOn Sunday Sept 8, for a 2 hour period from 10:00 AM until noon hour a river of orange snaked along and high above the bluffs overlooking Lake Erie at Clearville Park. I have a trailer at that location with a roof top viewing deck. All butterflies move in southwest direction and parallel to the lake shore. The bluffs are 80 feet above the water surface. The butterflies were in the air column above the bluffs with many butterflies so high they where just specks.  I confirmed they were monarchs through binoculars. This is caused by light winds from the west that blow the butterflies up against the lake. The butterflies have no need to go over the water here because their destination is Pt Pelee 60 miles to the south-west which offers the shortest distance over the lake to Ohio. Their direction of travel exactly parallels the lake which also just happens to be the direction they need to go to get to Mexico.  The lake shore acts like a funnel. I noticed that there were also  high numbers observed along the east shore of Lake Michigan and also on Lake Erie further to the north-east from my location.  When weather conditions are right I have overserved this funnelling of butterflies along the lake in previous years migrations. These conditions didn&rsquo;t last long because once the on-shore breeze starts up the butterflies disperse over a wider area so the numbers observed drop.  This same phenomenon occurs for migrating green-darner dragonflies at Clearville Park. They all of a sudden appear by the 10s of thousands. Its quite a site.  Green-darners migrate to the gulf coast of the US and Mexico.    The 15000 is my best hourly estimate. For two 10 minute periods I count as many as I can see and if I see a huge clump of them I estimate how many are in the clump. I compare the totals for each period and continue observing throughout the hour to see if the rate changes. I then used this information to estimate hourly totals.  When the on-shore breezes picked up the numbers of butterflies dropped to the lower values and this continued for several hours in the afternoon. The following two days the wind conditions changed again and butterflies observed drop to 25 per hour or less.  ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9941930,15000.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

The weather was initially overcast and very cool, but monarchs were migrating nonetheless. In fact, this is the strongest monarch migration day I have witnessed in many, many years. In this area, the shoreline drops cliff-like down to Lake Ontario, and this shoreline contained vast amounts of goldenrod, New England aster, but also many butterfly nectar plants planted by a local group. The monarchs streamed westward, and on some occasions, I could see over 100 monarchs at once in my view. Monarchs were arriving from the north and also from the east, possibly spurred on by the approaching cold front. It is impossible to determine how many monarchs passed this site this day, but 500,000 would not be an exaggeration. The number could have been larger. Slightly west, a dried up pond filled with cattails had sloping bank that were totally covered with yellow goldenrod. In the afternoon, I estimated that this yellow carpet had about 10,000 monarchs nectaring here. As for the tagging event, 200 attended and in less than 2 hours, 500 tags were used up.

On Tuesday upon exiting Essex Public School after dropping off milkweed leaves for the grade ones, two monarchs flew right in front of my face.  On my way to the car I kept noticing more. So I commenced a count for approximately one hour. I noted one per minute on average flying directly towards the school and either around or up and over the roof. Then on my drive home I was noting one per minute as well. I counted by texting myself each time that I saw a Monarch. Wednesday and Thursday the same thing happened. On Thursday I took a drive in a north-east direction from the school and travelled up and down some nearby concession roads that run north/south. I was again noting one monarch per minute with the naked eye for another hour. Many were flying at about the height of half a hydro pole right down to ground level. I noted three struck by vehicles. Every autumn my son has always remarked in his seven years attending Essex Public School that during recess the kids see monarchs. The past couple years that I have been helping in the grade one classes the children have approached me to say they are seeing monarchs in the schoolyard. I may have been overlooking for years the significance of these numbers. Today, it happened again, more monarchs upon exiting the school. So I counted on my drive home out of town and along North Talbot Road at least one per minute. After putting in a load of laundry I  went back up the road and stopped at the corner of North Talbot and Essex County Road 23. I sat there for 40 minutes and counted 95. This is an average of two per minute. Would that I could have sat there all day. So amazing.  Partly sunny, winds were 135°at 14 km/h and the temperature was 22°C according to the weather function on my mobile phone, when I made my observations today.  Most were flying between vehicle height, up to hydro pole height. All well below the windmills. I am hypothesising that this is an annual migration pathway. Perhaps as they round Lake St. Clair and head southwest is what brings them through the heart of Essex County?",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9968455,95.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

I could still always see waves of them.&nbsp; Sometimes they would all just start flying the other direction which I found humorous.&nbsp; But I continued to see them migrating all over west and north Toledo all day. Even out by my house on my drive home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly a few though as the afternoon went on.&nbsp; They would only fly the other direction once it was mostly sunny.Up untill about 11:30 they were all heading the same direction (southwest).If I ever see that many again in my life here in Toledo I will try to remember to call the news.&nbsp; Maybe their cameras work better. I honestly was seeing about 100 at a time.&nbsp; There was no way somebody could count them all because more and more would pass through.

I wait all year for a few days like these. Some years I never have a day like I had Wednesday, the 25th. My tiny yard had 49 at a time on the asters and goldenrods that I grow on my tiny sliver of yard (16th of an acre not forested). Strong southwest winds perhaps made more of them visit my way station. With winds out of the north they should on the move today.At 61 years old I have learned that sometimes the only thing to do is to go outside and watch and enjoy. So I did! For the last two afternoons I have put my work aside and gone outside to simply be among them and feel the joy of their company.It&rsquo;s been a tough summer here. Lots of spraying for mosquitos from the air and from the road. I was worried about the effects on the migration. But despite the sprays, and apparent lateness, there are lots of monarchs on the move for the past two days up here. We still have New England aster in full bloom and seaside goldenrod is finally in bloom.I let my yard fill with asters and goldenrods this year and let them grow to six feet. (Probably to the dismay of my neighbors!) The monarchs particularly like the taller plants. Migration is so tough - the least I can do is offer the monarchs a sheltered place to feed along their way. Between the wind and difficulty of plants being available at the right times, migration on the coast can be hit or miss.They are coming your way! Hope you planted lots and lots of asters and goldenrods!Thankful in New England, Louise ",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526430314.jpg,9944685,49.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

I counted the following numbers per minute... 88, 77, 138, 141, 178, 153, 165, 142, 166, 123. These numbers remained high for 45 minutes, averaging 137.1 Monarchs per minute! For the next 15 minutes, they averaged 40 Monarchs per minute. They were a continuous stream, not unlike vehicles going down a highway. I calculated that in my 90 degree cone of view, in a swath less than a quarter-mile wide, I observed over 6000 Monarchs pass overhead in one hour. Rain moved in after the hour's time, and the migrants sought shelter in the timber surrounding the gardens. If the Monarchs maintained these numbers all along the cold front, I can't imagine the numbers that are moving south. I can't wait to see the fallout in my garden in the morning. - Butler County Kansas - 20 miles East of Wichita.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,10013717,6769.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

This is just south of the ""Waterfront trail"" which is on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The greenspace extends to the edge of some bluffs that drop off before the beach. See  photo from last year.Wildflowers in our area are more stunted this year due to hot dry conditions in July.  To be clear the sightings were not on the beach, but in the upland area at the top of the bluffs. It is similar in many ways to the nearby Scarborough bluffs where Fred Urquart did his work. Often when winds are southward and strong the monarchs fly lower along the bluffs closer to the beach (i.e., instead of along the planted areas) to avoid the winds. This area is a monarch highway during the fall migration each year. Our nature group has been working to help monarchs for several years.

The monarchs were ""flightly"", easily disturbed or startled into flight from nectar sources, and clearly moving with an urgency to both feed and migrate. Clear directional flight westward was obvious, stopping to feed, but if disturbed would either circle back and try landing again on the flowering plant, or take off in a westerly direction, sometimes flying very high in the sky. It was most interesting to see how these monarchs manoevered and soared (as opposed to flapping their wings) in the strong winds, tacking back to a nectar source.  On September 5th, I tagged 104 monarchs. In the photo attached to this report, there were about 200 monarchs at the top of this tree. There may have been other nearby roosts.

The nectar plants with the highest density of butterflies were Liatris scariosa neuilandii.  The 3.5 acres where this picture was taken has a diverse variety of trees, shrubs, and native wildflowers, surrounded by large corn and soybean fields.I counted as accurately as I could.  This count for nectaring butterflies was made in about an hour, but I didn't time it.  I made several counts of each section of each bed and used the highest number when totalling.  Butterflies were flittering around so I may have counted some twice and not counted others at all.  My large garden of tall wildflowers could only be counted from the perimeter as it is too dense to penetrate.  Therefore, I only counted the butterflies nectaring at the top of the plants I could see and those flying just above the flowers.  I would say this count was low as there were areas of the garden I couldn't observe.There were additional monarchs  resting in many of our trees and shrubs all day on all sides of our property except the south.  Three areas I walked through just after counting the butterflies nectaring each had had 15 to 20 monarchs to fly out of the trees and shrubs.  Fewer flew out elsewhere. I did not actually see any monarchs flying on to or off of our property until dusk.  Then butterflies flew in from all directions to roost. Editor's note: see separate report for Roost for this day.

Most of the individuals came off the bay from the southwest, came to shore, then proceed north along the marsh. So they're going into the wind on an angle. Most of them are very high that are coming in from and/or going north from the bay, but once they come to land and head north they reduce altitude to about 20 or 30ft or so.      Which could mean that they're hopping between peninsulas over the water rather than following the dune line. Then once the Delaware water gap is thin enough further north they cross the bay (maybe when they start to detect less salt in the air or when they can see the shoreline across the bay). No evident storm, or anything coming from the south to influence them north. Editor&rsquo;s note: contacted observer for more information about this sighting. During northwest winds or any north component they typically are pushed against the coast and south. The peninsula of Cape May County acts as a funnel for these migrating monarchs and the majority of the monarchs end up being concentrated at Cape May Point. However, monarchs don&rsquo;t like to cross the Delaware Bay so move north along the Delaware side of the CMC peninsula to a point where the Delaware water gap is not as broad and possibly where they don&rsquo;t detect as much salinity. Then they&rsquo;ll cross at that point as far as we know. So that&rsquo;s why they were headed north. On this particular day there were an abnormal amount of monarchs moving north than usual. None were nectaring in the grounds at the East Point Lighthouse (which is also abnormal), they were all actively migrating. So it was more so the rate at which they were moving north that was significant. Most of the individuals you see around Cape May are feeding for the most part and the ones that do start to move north don&rsquo;t seem to move quite at the rate and at the numbers by which were passing by East Point. The interesting aspect of it, is that while counting the incoming monarchs, the incoming individuals were coming from off the bay (from a southwest direction which makes sense since it was northeast winds. They were going against the winds for uplift) to the point of the peninsula where the East Point Lighthouse is. Then once they reached the lighthouse and thus the shore, they continued north along the beach.  So my guess would be that these individuals coming in from off the bay were coming from another peninsula further south along the Delaware. So instead of riding the typical thermals from the dunes along the coast, they seem to possibly be hopping between the peninsulas that come out in various areas along the Delaware Bay coast of New Jersey. So they cross the water only when there&rsquo;s a visible peninsula on the other side.

Tremendous numbers of monarchs have been at Cape May Point for the last 4 days, feeding on seaside goldenrod along the dunes and in various gardens around town.  Roosts of up to 1200 have been found in the late afternoons.  It's impossible to come up with anything resembling an accurate count; 10,000 is certainly low.Additional notes posted 10/12/20: We had seven consecutive days with a lot of monarchs here, which is quite unusual &mdash; usually when we see a big spike in numbers it decreases within 2 or 3 days.  We watched a lot departing on day 5, but more arrived that day and the numbers stayed very high.  Today (10/12/20) is day 8 and it&rsquo;s very rainy and windy - it will be interesting to see how many monarchs will be around when the weather clears.We found between 5 and 10 roosting clusters each night, and often would hear about a roosting group that we hadn&rsquo;t found the next day.  One of our team members methodically counted one of the clusters and came up with 1200.  I feel quite certain that 10,000 is a conservative estimate.During the day we were seeing monarchs nectaring on seaside goldenrod, which grows abundantly on the dunes and upper beach, all the way from Cape May Point to the east end of Cape May City, more than 2 miles distant.  They were also actively nectaring in gardens on flowers such as New England Aster, Mexican Sunflower, Zinnias, Coneflowers, etc., on the flowers of Butterfly Bush and Crape Myrtle, and on the flowers of English Ivy vines, the latter flowers seemingly more than ever.  You couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere within 100 meters of the coast without seeing a lot of monarchs in the air.Temperatures have remained relatively warm throughout this period, so not all monarchs formed roosting clusters overnight, some just settled into the vegetation along the dunes and in other habitats near the shore, while others did cluster &mdash; and those roosting clusters occurred in a variety of plants, including pines, junipers, aspens, and even right in the ivy vines.  We found roosts from the extreme SW corner of Cape May Point east to Cape May Point State Park, and we heard of roosts about 2 miles north near the shores of Delaware Bay, an area known as Town Bank.  There were no doubt some roosting clusters in Cape May City as well, but we didn&rsquo;t search there.Most of the days through this stretch were a bit warmer than the seasonal average with sunny or mostly sunny conditions, winds ranged from light to moderate, from the northwest many days but switching to the southwest several times.  <a href=""https://njaudubon.org/monarch-monitoring/"">Cape May Monarch Monitoring Project Website</a>",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2020/10/1526490050.jpg,10022360,10000.0,0,Monarch PEAK Migration,0

I didn't count the ones I saw in roosts because they were probable the same ones I saw feedingI was using a counter for most of the time I was walking and counted 466. But stopped counting near the end. So I estimated 500. There is a boardwalk that runs through an area of dunes and a road that comes back through a similar but different area. Total length about 1,5 miles. The goldenrod is spread out on both sides of the path. In some places you can see a few hundred feet from the path. In others only a few feet. I counted as many as I could see, realizing that some may have been double counted but that there were also others that would be on plants and not visible. If I double back through an area I don't count in that area again. I walked for about 2 hours between 3:30 and 5:30 and observed the roosts (see other report under Fall Roost) from about 5:30 to sundown about 6:20.  I am not permitted to walk out into the dunes to look for other sites or to get a different angle. so those views are limited.  Some of the areas of goldenrod were big patched while others were more interspersed with dune grasses and other plants. Yesterday (10/10) the butterflies were widely dispersed. There were a few plants that had several butterflies, but I'd say none had more than 4. BTW I did see a couple that apparently didn't get the memo about diapause.

I have a certain amount of butterfly bushes, planted specifically for the monarchs. Usually, they arrive, one at the time, and rest on the bushes for a while and then continue their migration after 10-15mn. So, I assume that if I see them leaving, they don&rsquo;t try to fool me by turning around and coming back. If I see, like on Saturday, a constant stream of 4-5 butterflies on the bushes, for a period from 8AM to 4PM or 8H, my count of 20 is probably on a low side. I am out in the yard starting around 8AM and try to check the bushes regularly.    In Fort Lee, I believe we are right on the path of the New England migration; they cross the Hudson over Manhattan, Fort Lee, and Secaucus. I always see them coming from the North-East going South-West.
