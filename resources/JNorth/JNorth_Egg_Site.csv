At times the Monarchs flew in between us, at other times across the road and at other times what seemed to be a hundred feet in the air on wind currents against the backdrop of a beautiful, clear, cloudless, blue sky.  Milkweed was incredibly abundant along the entire stretch of the Lake George shoreline in New York as well as the Lake Champlain shoreline in Vermont.  In some places the Milkweed was spent and already shedding leaves and in others there were fresh stalks and even spotted one stand that had fresh flowers on them on the New York side of Lake George.  Not only is the migration in full swing between New York and Vermont but I almost regretted flipping over a few leaves of fresh milkweed near Ticonderoga New York and low and behold I found a fresh Monarch egg nestled in between a bunch of aphids.

I left the potted plant in tact and my husband helped me build a frame around it with a hinged door.  We then attached netting to the frame.  If this method works, I hope to be able to release 3 beautiful monarchs in a few weeks!",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9967310,-999999.999,1,Monarch Egg Sighted,0

Assistant Secretary for Environment, Heberto Lliteras Cavazos indicated that Victoria is one of the main towns where the butterfly stops to lay their eggs.

We found monarch eggs and a larva at the Put-in-Bay winery, a 5th instar at DJ parker's B&amp;B garden, a 5th instar on the milkweed planted in front of the butterfly house, and lots of monarch activity at the lighthouse waystation.  The sunflower field adjacent to the lighthouse has been mowed, but the lighthouse waystation is serving as a great nectar source and place for reproductive females to lay their eggs.  On Saturday, I noted two males and four females.  One very old and worn female was egg dumping, I saw her lay 6 eggs on one 6&rdquo; tall milkweed plant, and 10 eggs on one 8&rdquo; tall plant.  She was basking on the ground at times, and seemed almost too weak to fly high at times--she flew up into the tall coreopsis to nectar, then bask and returned to laying eggs on the young milkweed shoots.  The other younger females were laying eggs everywhere, but especially on the milkweed that had been pruned this summer and now sported fresh new growth.  Females laid eggs on top of the leaves, on stems, and the underside of leaves.  One female was missing her entire right hindwing, and she often laid eggs on the upperside of the leaves.  The other females laid primarily on the underside, and skillfully moved throughout the milkweed patch, weaving in and out amongst the milkweed plants.  All ovipositing monarchs heavily preferred the common milkweed, and used it on both ends of the garden.  The males were nectaring heavily, and one male was nectaring so heavily from the ironweed that Maya was able to sneak up on him and grab him with her bare hands.  I saw two milkweed tussock moth larvae crawling around, looking for a place to pupate.  Visitors saw me taking photos and saw the waystation sign, and came over to ask me questions.  We spoke at length, then I gave them the brochures I had in my car and directed them to the nature center.  All monarchs nectared heavily from the tall coreopsis, which was clearly the preferred nectar source now, as well as the ironweed.  The heat and high winds make it challenging to grow plants at this location, but the natives have done very well.  On Sunday, I did not see the old female but three females were again ovipositing and males were nectaring.  I noticed one monarch had a lot of black near the tip of the forewing--missing some white spots.

These reports are in stark contrast to what I saw in my travels through the Traverse City, MI area this past week.We drove up to Interlochen, MI on the 23rd.  We did not see a single adult monarch on our drive through the center of the state and into Interlochen.We visited the Sleeping Bear Dunes area two days in a row.  I found a 4th instar basking on A.s. along the bike path next to the Dune Climb.  No adults.  This has always been my hotspot, where I have seen excellent monarch activity in years past.  Some might recall my story about Big Boy, the old, worn patrolling male who chased off several other males in a milkweed patch adjacent to the Dune Climb parking lot last year.  There were no patrolling males this year.  https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMmIa4fYpNYV7jsT6stiq8kTeaJQwvU-iKGRkAodmaFfo54S8Pc3Z-1saI1N6d9oQ?key=R01UdG4zakZiSEFkdGwyRmJJUGoxdG9mT3RhcVJBI checked my other hotspots.  I searched the lookout points 9&amp;10 on the Pierce Stocking scenic drive, where I found a plump 5th instar last year.  Nothing this year.  https://www.facebook.com/candace.sarikonda.3/posts/1737370443200314?pnref=story and https://www.facebook.com/candace.sarikonda.3/posts/1737368389867186?pnref=storyMy family patiently waited as I spent 1 1/2 hours checking the milkweed stands along the Lake MI shoreline, on either side of Old Mission Point lighthouse.  I found a gorgeous crab spider.  I found an egg sucked dry, most likely by a spider.  I found a few early instar chew holes, but they were not fresh.  The latex was long dried out, the plant getting leathery.  Not one larvae, not one adult anywhere.  Last year, there was a patrolling male and I quickly found two late instar larvae basking.  https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMu2HdHLJMQAYgwdufIr2IfYDqyFsz09ORnE9hRa12D5XGup79vpicgOjOg4oJkbg?key=d3k1VENGcnB0VUoxUi1KSUN5bUpNMllRMzk4dHlnSurprisingly, despite the lack of rain, there were plenty of stands of nice and healthy milkweed.  Not much for nectar other than the milkweed, spotted knapweed is all over.  Joe Pye is beginning to bloom, but plants are few and far between.We drove home to Ohio on July 30, no adults seen.  It was overcast and we experienced a light rain a few times as we neared central MI. Goldenrod is beginning to bloom.I did not see an adult monarch this entire week-long trip.  Not one.  I am praying there are adults waiting to eclose any minute, or that the premigration is just a bit late and will move through any day now.

I saw about a dozen Monarchs in a couple of hours, patrolling, chasing, nectaring, and while covering only a fraction of the farm, found about 100 eggs and several young caterpillars. At least one cat was still eating its eggshell, and at least one egg was dark and about to hatch. Several plants had five or six eggs, one two-stem plant had seven. A large majority of plants in the front area, which had been mowed this winter had at least one egg, and many had two. Quite a few had three. The only Asclepias tuberosa I could find had six eggs on it. The rest were not accessible. Nobody wants to wade into the blackberry patch in high winds.Milkweeds in the area that did not get mowed had fewer eggs. I suspect it is a matter of physical accessibility since we have tall thick prairie vegetation, and is something for me to remember.One Monarch was nectaring from a Prairie Onion, Allium canadense var fraseri.Some of the milkweeds look strange this year. Most of the Green Milkweeds are putting up just single stems now. I suspect the extra stems will follow shortly. A few were strangely attenuated (in full sun). A couple showed signs of leaf damage by some kind of critter that wasn't a Monarch, including a leaf miner. One plant had the big ragged holes in the leaves(not the way a Monarch cat eats them), and still had three fresh Monarch eggs on it.Two males were patrolling territories. One I watched for about 20 minutes rested on oak leaves and then took flight and chased everything that came near, including lots of smaller butterflies that were not Monarchs. After the little butterflies were vanquished he would take a couple of slow laps up and down the treeline and then return to a resting place with a good view.My ""colossal"" Waystation was really doing its job yesterday.Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,0,100.0,0,Monarch Egg Sighted,0

I observed monarchs now and then, but my strong focus was on trying to see the tiny eggs and almost invisible newborn monarch larvae on the milkweed plants ~ trying to be careful and gentle and not disturb them as well. The monarchs I did see were variously resting, nectaring, egg-laying, and flying around. It was a cloudy day, windy, around 77 degrees F, and around 75% humidity.Here are the results of today's milkweed survey. I looked at 268 milkweed plants and found a total of 332 eggs and 57 larvae. Some milkweed had 0 eggs and some had multiple eggs.

I looked at milkweed in several different sections, some in the upper pastures and some in the lower pastures. I also explored the bottomland area that had been flooded on April 28th after heavy rainfall from thunderstorms caused the creek to overflow.Here are the results of this weekend&rsquo;s milkweed survey. I looked at 326 milkweed plants and found a total of 189 eggs and 107 larvae. These are the egg count results:200 milkweed w/0 eggs ~ (64 of these milkweed had 1 or more larvae on them) 91 milkweed w/1 egg19 milkweed w/2 eggs8 milkweed w/3 eggs6 milkweed w/4 eggs1 milkweed w/5 eggs0 milkweed w/6 eggs1 milkweed w/7 eggsThese are the larvae count results:61 1st instars28 2nd instars15 3rd instars3 4th instarsThe bottomland where flowing flood waters had occurred had a high percentage of milkweed with eggs compared to the rest of the surveyed sections. I had seen two monarchs actively laying eggs in this area on the morning following the storms and flooding. There were also a good number of 1st instars and 1 2nd instar in areas I knew were completely underwater. This seems to mean that some of the eggs remained viable while underwater and hatched successfully in the next few days. There was a 3rd and a 4th instar on some tall milkweed &ldquo;towers&rdquo; on slightly higher ground in the flood area. Their milkweed plants had been tall enough and sturdy enough to keep them above the water flow that occurred on their &ldquo;island.&rdquo; Here are the counts specifically in the flooded area. I looked at 52 milkweed plants and found 54 eggs and 15 larvae. Of the 15 larvae found, there were 12 1st instars, 1 2nd instar, 1 3rd instar, and 1 4th instar. These counts are already included in the general survey above.This is a photo of the 4th instar larva that I found on one of the tall &amp; sturdy milkweed ""towers"" in the flooded area.

I looked at 201 individual milkweed plants (Asclepias viridis). On them I observed a total of 446 monarch eggs and 38 monarch larvae. The specific numbers are as follows:77 milkweed w/0 eggs29 milkweed w/1 egg30 milkweed w/2 eggs22 milkweed w/3 eggs10 milkweed w/4 eggs9 milkweed w/5 eggs9 milkweed w/6 eggs4 milkweed w/7 eggs3 milkweed w/8 eggs2 milkweed w/9 eggs1 milkweed w/10 eggs1 milkweed w/11 eggs3 milkweed w/12 eggs1 milkweed w/25 eggsThere were 38 larvae found and they all were 1st instars. The larvae were on milkweed plants that also had eggs on them. Some of the eggs on the milkweeds were darkening, looking like they were close to hatching, especially on the morning of March 28. I saw more new larvae when I checked a few milkweeds later in the day (not included in the survey).One thing that really stands out in this survey is the large number of eggs on some of the milkweed plants. I would say most of these were the earliest laid, when milkweed was still emerging and scarce. Some monarchs laid multiple eggs because of the scarcity. In addition, other monarchs laid eggs on plants which already had eggs, due again to insufficient milkweed. Thankfully, the milkweed numbers started to catch up and the monarchs have gone back to a smaller number of eggs on each plant ~ their preferred egg-laying method.This is a photo of a milkweed crown with multiple monarch eggs on it, including one or two that look close to hatching.",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/03/1526391266.jpg,9922775,446.0,0,Monarch Egg Sighted,0

174389,1526393477,2019-04-05,Monarch Egg Sighted,313,30.371,-95.816,1,"Today I did a survey of the milkweed in our pastures checking for monarch eggs and larvae. I looked at a total of 387 individual milkweed plants (Asclepias viridis). On these plants I observed 313 monarch eggs and 110 monarch larvae.The specific numbers are as follows:218 milkweed w/0 eggs88 milkweed w/1 egg42 milkweed w/2 eggs21 milkweed w/3 eggs14 milkweed w/4 eggs3 milkweed w/5 eggs0 milkweed w/6 eggs1 milkweed w/7 eggs1st instar larvae = 612nd instar larvae = 423rd instar larvae = 7In some cases a milkweed plant had both eggs and larvae. I started the survey around noon. It had been a foggy morning and now was overcast with a temperature of 71 degrees F, 93% humidity, and a light breeze from the east ~ perfect for close inspections of milkweed. I noted that some of the milkweed had been damaged by the two nights of freezing temperatures earlier in the week, especially the tall, slender variety. These were often browning and wilting. A large number of the 1st instars I saw today were newborns: 37 of the 61 1st instars looked like they had just hatched today. Of the 313 eggs I observed today, at least 15 looked ready to hatch.By 2:30pm it was 75 degrees F, now partly cloudy with the sun coming out more and more, 82% humidity, still a light breeze from the east. Throughout the afternoon I saw monarchs, some flying, a couple of females egg-laying, and some nectaring. But my focus was looking down at the milkweed, so I was not being observant of the monarchs.Later in the afternoon, my son, Noah, came out and helped me with the survey, taking notes as I checked the plants. I am sure that overall I missed some of the eggs and larvae ~ they are very small and I was trying to be cautious about disturbing them. The number of eggs on individual milkweeds is lower than was seen on the last survey of March 28th. In that survey there were quite a few instances of milkweed with 8+ eggs. Thankfully, the monarchs have more milkweed to choose from now. This is a photo of the milkweed plant with seven eggs ~ six can be seen (one partially) and one more is on the other side of the crown.

I watched the butterflies laying eggs too.Reporting the cats separately.  Have not been finding many cats this year ... but in a few days?Editor's note: contacted observer for details on estimation process. Here is her reply: OK, so I went out to get some food for the 20-30 cats we have in our raising meshes.  We had notably not seen many caterpillars since the first flush in June.  What I found was lots and lots of eggs, sometimes 4 or 5 on one leaf.  Standing there surrounded by head-high milkweed, I could easily see 100 eggs without moving.  This, in a field of milkweed about 300 feet long by 200 feet wide.  I personally have not been successful with raising eggs in the past, so I let them be, and went elsewhere to hunt a food supply.  I checked 3 patches that I often visit and found the same thing.  100 or more eggs within arms reach.  I think 1000 seen may be a very low estimate.

I didn't have time to check if an egg was successfully planted, was heading back in and then off to the library.  Another intact and brightly colored female was also seen in the front yard nearby laying an egg on one of the tropical milkweeds planted in the front bed.  The 2 monarchs interacted briefly as they flew to nectar on the same tropical milkweed plant, then settled on 2 separate plants. Later as I weeded in the front yard sometime between 1 and 2 pm I checked a few milkweeds and saw 1 separate freshly laid egg on a tropical milkweed in a patio pot.  It's difficult to do a survey of all the short milkweed sprouts in the yard without stepping on others coming up, so I'm only reporting the 2 eggs I'm sure of.
