This was 3 times the number from 2013 (only 10) which was the lowest record ever (in 16 years).Planted native area milkweeds.I have several butterfly weed milkweed (A. tuberosa) from two years ago. (Butterflies love the blooms--they nectar on these plants before anything else I have blooming and stay much longer on them.) Planted this year: common milkweed (A. syrica) and swamp milkweed (both pink and white, (A. incarnata)). The 2 catepillars decimated the first year white ballet leaves on two plants but the plants are still alive. I will add more plants next year...especially more white ballet. Also, I am hoping seeds next year will spread my patches (I now have 3 flower gardens with milkweed.) First year plants do not flower. I am having some issues with ants trying to farm aphids on the milkweeds. Spraying soapy water on the milkweed plants late evening (don't want to harm other bugs) to try to control. I do squash all the milkweed bugs that I see on the plants since they damage seeds(--they are red and black and look a bit like a colorful firefly.) PLANT Milkweed--help Monarchs!!!Warning--common milkweed has underground runners so it will take over, over the years so plant it where you do not mind it spreading....swamp milkweed and butterfly weed are more likely to stay in place. None of the milkweeds like to be transplanted...some will do it reluctantly but will be unhappy for some time. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9935424,2.0,0,"Monarch, Captive-Reared",0

They have all pupated and two have emerged from chrysalis and were released today.  This season, I had about 5 caterpillars that made the crawl to the top and just kind of stop and not J-up.  I don't know why except maybe weakened or suffered from stress of being captured or enclosed with other caterpillars. Overall, I have released at least 60 this year and still have approximately 15 pupae still hanging.  There were 4 to 5 pupae that darkened but never emerged.  I don't know why that occurred either. Every year will be a new experience and I am planning for next year with more efficient enclosures and newly transplanted milkweed and new milkweed sites to gather the caterpillars.  I am assuming that this is helping the butterfly population because of the persistent predation to the caterpillars. Last year I let the caterpillars stay on the plant and would find they would be gone in a day or two after citing.

I turned off the mower, went and got all the tenants' children, had them line up in the front yard near the cedars' and then...I started the rider and drove past the cedars again...the children screamed with delight as they were engulfed in dancing monarchs.

As with many of our caterpillars raised this year we found this one in the soybean field.  It developed slower than others and was small when it formed a chrysalis.  Maybe it was a victim of pesticide use on the field.  Will report final numbers raised in another report.  This was a sad note to end our season on but I have to think of all the rest who were possibly helped by our keeping them from predators...,-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9968455,1.0,0,"Monarch, Captive-Reared",0

I still had 37 chrysalises that had not emerged. My calculations had them coming out anywhere from 10/3 to 10/8.  I packed them up in the car in two different containers and during the next several days 30 monarchs emerged. The first came out before we pulled out of the driveway; she was released in western Nebraska. The rest emerged in the next 4 days. Since there were so many and we were focused on the sites I was not able to record how many each day and what sex they were. They traveled with us from central Iowa, west through Nebraska into Wyoming. North through the Grand Tetons, Yellow Stone National Park, with stops at Old Faithful, mud pits, and the falls. Continued back east through the Bighorn National park, Devils Tower, Deadwood, SD, Mt Rushmore, and Needles Canyon Drive. Continuing east we had a long and leisurely drive through the Badlands SD. During the trip I provided sugar nectar, and orange Gatorade soaked in sponges. They crossed the continual divide several times so not sure if I let them go which way they would migrate, besides the temps were cool and very little vegetation for them to feed on.Today 10/10/2015, I released 29 monarchs back at home where they started from.  24 have tags, 10 females and 14 males, including 3 males and 2 females without tags.Total monarchs I have raised from eggs found on my common milkweed plants (started from seed early spring 2015) and released this season -- 195!!",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2015/10/1444508531.jpg,9986321,29.0,0,"Monarch, Captive-Reared",0

On June 8th, I gathered 7 more eggs, wishing I had room for more. I then ordered 100 more floral tubes and 6 more monarch castles. Three of the 7 eggs were near each other on a common milkweed bud and were positioned in such a way that it would make a good photo. My husband, a professional photographer, was delighted, and watched it carefully. On June 9th, he set up his macro gear, Canon 7D II with a 65mm lens that goes up to 5 times life size. After taking a few photographs, he filmed one of the eggs hatching, which then fed on its egg shell a couple minutes. It then crawled to one of the another, yet-to-hatch eggs with the caterpillar just beginning to move within.  When the larva began eating that egg shell, Leo zoomed in more to document what was happening.  It penetrated the egg shell and made a small hole.  The caterpillar inside was still high in the shell, but not at the top.  Looking close at a still shot, Leo could see two indentations in the top of the head, but could not tell if they were bite marks.  The larva left and a short time later the second egg hatched.  It never did eat any of its own egg shell, but did eat a lot of the one that was still occupied.  It would eat and rest, eat and rest for, for almost three hours.  All of the feeding was just around the corner, so to speak, and we could never tell if the one inside was being bitten.  The one inside never moved during the second larva's visit so we assumed it died during or shortly after the first visit.  The second larva left and never returned.  Leo focused in as close as he could, and it was still impossible to see any bite marks on the unfortunate caterpillar still within its egg shell.

I had one more in chrysalis but I bumped it releasing one of the female adults, it fell to the floor and now the chrysalis has a dent. I fear it is a fatal injury. As soon as the last adult emerges and  leaves I will use a light bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water -- 10% solution) to thoroughly clean the cage then rinse even more thoroughly and dry. I will then go looking for more eggs on my milkweed to bring in to raise. I provide daily new milkweed for them to eat in small planters. As long as the cats' cage is cleaned daily early in their development and twice a day as they grow larger so there is no frazz (aka poop), raising cats inside can produce lower mortality rates than leaving them outside. Cage must have air circulation but no holes large enough for them (even when tiny) to escape. Cleaning is critical.

The butterfly went long past the time when I expected it to emerge, and I took it back inside, where it came out three hours later -- too late to release.

I brought ten in when I discovered them eating on dead stem.  I brought only ten in because I was very unsure I could get enough milkweed to feed them.  I had a small amount of milkweed in a more protected area that I brought in little by little to supply their need.  What a journey this was for me!  I have many photos of all the stages of development.  I gathered some flowers for them.   They were in pots and I released the monarchs near the flowers.  The day after a release I discovered the one in the photo in our back yard feeding on small yellow daisy-like flowers that I was not aware was there.   After I discovered him on this little weed, I looked around me and they were everywhere all over the yard.  I thought they might hang around the flowers I had gathered in pots for them and I did see one or maybe two buzzing the flowers in the pots for about two days after release.   They did not seem to need me and my flowers.  I wonder if they went north or south after I released them.   Because it was not yet time to head north I am guessing they traveled south.

Today, she practiced flying outside and I caught this close photo of her drinking nectar.  I also got lots of video of her feeding. I believe she got very used to me during recuperation for she does not mind me handling her, and she frequently flies over to me.  I believe she will be fine when released in a day or two.  I started this project by accident, but it's addictive.  I'm an amateur so have been dependent on research. I've released 32 so far, but this one is almost like a pet!

Perhaps 1 -3 every few days. It's now Sept 15 and here in PA there are a decreasing number of nectar blossoms, so they seem to emerge and ""move on"".

I looked online again and realized that some believe the flys can lay their eggs on monarch eggs.  I can attest to this as the number of infected caterpillars far outnumbered the number of hatched caterpillars I brought in to rear.  Then there was the poisoning which took the worst toll.  My nursery, high end who swears no pesticides are used on their milkweed got a bad batch.  I bought 9 beautiful plants mid summer and I lost so many cats I lost count.  As soon as I took them off the new leaves and put them strictly on the old plants, the problems almost completely stopped. And yes I let the nursery know.   I saved some by rinsing them off. I had to get rid of tons of eggs too because I wouldn't have enough to feed them by the end.  As it was, my milkweed was 99 percent gone by the time the last cat pupated.

So far I have released 51 healthy monarchs and euthanized 6 because of OE or deformities.  Throughout the season monarchs would visit episodically and eggs would likewise appear in batches.  Successfully-reared Monarchs from these batches would range from 5% to 60%.  I would guess that the overall success rate was 25%.  (The swallowtail was the only one of 8 swallowtail larva that made it to pupation--they were on nursery-purchased dill when they died). Overall,though, this 25% was probably a higher success rate than each of the last two years.This autumn I'll be planting the potted milkweed that I purchased this year and moving the seedlings around so I should start next spring with at least twice the plants that I began this year with.  And perhaps we'll have a good hard freeze this winter that will kill off any lingering OE spores and NPV.  ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9986256,7.0,0,"Monarch, Captive-Reared",0

It&rsquo;s a miracle he&rsquo;s still alive but he is sexually assaulting the new girls lol. Trying hard here in oc to help monarchs.

I released her about 45 minutes ago and held my breath to see how she would fly and she was perfect.  Winging it up then soaring on the air and landing in a large tree in the neighbors yard.

I will release them in the country or will release them at the arboretum depending on if it is a weekend or not. I live in a townhouse and I miss my gardens when I lived in a house. I tore out the small strip of grass between my sidewalk and my neighbors entryway and planted about milkweed plants and have a lot of nectar producing plants as well. I have a few milkweeds in pots. I observed a female come and feed on my flowers. I also saw her, or a different one on a different day, lay eggs. I have been collecting eggs on my leaves since I planted the milkweed. I presume that she lays them when I am at work. I haven't seen any legs recently so this must be all of the batch for this year. I hope I am successful at doing this. It is labor intensive as I have them in so many different containers and the ones in chrysallis in a large net enclosure. I make sure their containers are kept clean and collect leaves daily.

We collected the eggs from our vegetable garden turned milkweed plot on a daily basis, freshening the food supply at the same time.  The caterpillars were raised indoors until they were in their 5th instar. At that point the ""fatties"" were transferred to a protected container on an open air porch.  From there the caterpillars could wander and choose a place to become a chrysalis.  We were honored and delighted to witness the change of the caterpillar to chrysalis exhibiting the wildly flexing ""hula"" twist dance to liberate the new form from the old skin.  It was fascinating to watch the emergence of baby butterflies from the protective casings in which they transformed, expanding and drying for first flight a few hours from ""birth"" (saving all of the casing for a later more accurate count).Today there are 6 chrysalis waiting to hatch and fly with one tiny 2nd instar inside on freshly sprouted milkweed.

This is the first year my new milkweed plants are mature enough to support a substantial number of hungry caterpillars. Many eggs are laid but survival rates are low. Since August 30th I&rsquo;ve released only 8 monarchs from the first 15 caterpillars brought in. 4 beautiful males yesterday were so eager to fly after being pent up for the first 20 hours because of bad weather that I decided they were strong enough to be given the chance. They had spent as much time with the flight cage outside as possible the previous day. But only got about 8 hours of freedom to test their new wings and proboscis  before the winds picked up and it started raining on and off. I hope I made the right choice for them as only one more morning today gave them that chance before remnants of tropical storm Gordon will be rolling through for the next few days.,-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526364948.jpg,10002572,4.0,0,"Monarch, Captive-Reared",0

However, he did not leave and on Sunday, October 14 at around 14:00 we saw him fly low across the road heading south into a moderate Southwest wind.  Temperatures were the best they have been in days for him to move and the sun was shining (high 14C low 4C.) He was not the only one on the move as we saw a large roost at Point Pelee National Park in the evening. Our last Monarch of the season (see photograph) put on a beautiful display for the grade ones in Mrs. Smith's class who were able to witness his emergence.  He was released at lunchtime in a sheltered spot out of the strong winds. I hope these last two make it as we are headed into a week of temperatures in the negatives overnight. We have had a very successful season and raised our most monarchs to date. At times it seemed like a full time job. Our losses (10) due to tachnid fly and dead caterpillars occurred mainly with the higher instars harvested and also late in the season (September.) The best success rate was from eggs and early instars.  Approximately 50% of our harvests were from roadsides while gathering leaves.This season had the earliest start (June 27 versus August 17)and latest finish (October 11 versus October 6.)  I hope our efforts have an effect on the numbers in Mexico. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/10/1526381487.jpg,9968455,207.0,0,"Monarch, Captive-Reared",0

Her birth brought the total number of indoor-reared monarchs this spring season to 118. All of them were from monarch eggs and larvae brought in from our meadows over the course of these spring months. There were some eggs and larvae that did not make it (very few thankfully) and three chrysalises that had problems developing. Mostly it was a very healthy group ~ just the challenge of supplying lots of fresh milkweed all the time! Every now and then I was out at night with a flashlight and scissors finding a few extra milkweed leaves for hungry caterpillars. It was always a happy moment when they successfully formed their chrysalises. Currently, a lot of the milkweed is in the seedpod stage, though there are some that are fresh and flowering here and there.I love seeing all the Journey North monarch reports. Sometimes I wonder if one of the monarchs born here is in a report from the north ~ could happen!

(I did this so the aphids and predators near the lawn did not attach the milkweed or the eggs. Outside,3 caterpillars hatched and grew up. One big cat climbed out when I wasn't watching, escaped the container and hopefully found a bush to hang on and pupate. That's when I decided to put the 2 remaining cats and one of the milkweed plants into an aquarium with a screen top. One caterpilller anxiously started to reach for the side of the tank and made himself a silky, sticky ladder above him before he took each step up the wall of the aquarium. He finally settled down in a corner half way up the side of the tank.The other cat kept eating milkweed.This morning at 7am, that cat on the glass wall was hanging in the corner and the other was still eating milkweed. After a few hours the one hanging in the corner started to grow fatter in the middle and another hour later, his skin split up his back which took about a minute as he pushed his skin to the top of him near the threads that were attaching him to the wall. As his new moist green body dripped a couple drops of liquid to the floor, he fattened up more and more. He began to quickly squirm around, moving left and right and wiggling around for a couple minutes, trying to get rid of the crumpled black skin with crinkled antennae. He finally broke it from the thread and flung it to the ground. He breathed a few more breaths and settled down as his new chrysalis body formed into shape and hardened up. It sparkled with gold dots along a row. Now we just have to wait til he emerges in a couple weeks. Looking forward for number 2 caterpillar to make the metamorphosis. It is like magic.

The caterpillar apprared ready to J so I kept it secluded and watched it and sure enough it did J.  Now my escape worries were over for ten days or so.  I hung on the stem until the leaf dried up so I repositioned the chrysalis on a stem I gathered in the campground we were in.  The monarch emerged right on schedule on Oct 2, 2019.  Having raised and released 75 between March &amp; July this year and many more last year, I knew that after a few hours of wing drying time, the new beautiful Monarch would be crawling around, fluttering and flying about.  After a couple hours for this to occur, I took the stem I'd repositioned it on out to the garden and placed it near some delicious pollen flowers.  The butterfly remained on the stem a bit longer thru the afternoon, but by late afternoon he (yes it was a beautiful male) was gone.  The thing is that he was no longer in Pulaski, NY, we had moved to Ocean View, DE by October, thus giving him a head start in his migration.

In total, 57 were successfully raised and released. The last 10 were raised on a combination of milkweed and organic butternut squash. The last 10 were released between 8/22 and 8/29.Of those that were not raised successfully, the first 9 5th instars managed to escape the enclosure at pupation and I don't know what happened to them. 1 4th instar fell off the plant and got stepped on :(. 1 5th instar escaped and pupated outside of the enclose but was parasitized and did not complete pupation. 10 chrysalids did not survive the July heat wave. 1 that survived but got stuck in the chrysalid during eclosure. I was able to free it using forceps but it was badly deformed and the wings never expanded. I was able to sustain it on honey water for a couple of days in a pot of nectar flowers, but something eventually ate it. 2 other butterflies managed to eclose during the heat wave but died withing 3 hours before I could free them from the eclosure. All butterflies that died were raised on Asclepias physocarpa purchased from a native nursery in Simi Valley. It appears that they succumbed to a combination of heat and Ophryocystis elektroscirrha, so I suspect these plants were infected. Since I do not have enough milkweed to support more caterpillars at this time, I have enclosed the plants (all are potted) in a mesh cage to prevent egg laying.

As the weather was starting to get cold, I put the milkweed pot in my greenhouse on November 24th, so that the larvae could get larger.

On Dec. 4th, it had climbed to the top of the popup tent and started to form a ï¿½J.ï¿½ On the morning of Dec. 5th, it had formed a chrysalis. It is still in chrysalis in my greenhouse now. I expect it to come out of chrysalis any day now. I am really not sure if I should feed it nectar (sugar water or orange slices) for a while until we get a warm day or really what to do with it. I can keep it in the popup in the greenhouse as long as necessary. Any advice would be helpful. This is my second time to do this. The first one, a male, flew away on a nice day on November 27th.
