For about the last 2 weeks I have been watching a growing number of monarch caterpillars on my 3 semi-puny milkweeds (the frost had me cut them way back). I've been shifting them around from the denuded branches to the ones with leaves but yesterday the situation became so dire that I had to scour the nurseries in Victoria and finally found 3 nice bushy plants on the 4th try. With about 2 1/2 doz. fat  caterpillars already having moved off to pupate I currently only have about 1 1/2 to 2 doz. left and my plants should feed them well .... if I don't get more eggs. And yesterday a female monarch was observed prospecting for a good place to do just that.Are there any alternative foods to milkweeds? Hopefully not too expensive?

I finally managed to carve out time to check my garden briefly on 6-27-14.  I found a 5th instar on common milkweed near my mailbox.  The next morning, I got up early and checked my yard.  I searched nearly all the common milkweed and most of the swamp milkweed in my front yard; in 2 hours of searching, I found 2 more 5ths, and evidence of another 5th (frass, but no larva to be found), no eggs.  I returned home later in the evening to find an adult monarch patrolling my yard, my first confirmed sighting this season.  It was flying fast, skimming the tops of my milkweed and nectar plants, behaving like a territorial male (repeatedly circling the yard).

I planted the plant which looked ragged but it became a nice, almost 4&prime; bush. On 6/23/15 I doused it with an enviro friendly insecticide because it was infested with aphids. However since the aphids were not affected, the next day I started spraying the plant with 2tsp soap to 16oz water. To my horror I saw a tiny caterpillar so I stopped. I then checked every leaf which looked like it was chewed and rescued about 5 tiny cats. I placed them on a plate inside the house with milkweed leaves. I continued &ldquo;soaping&rdquo; the plant and after an hour I hosed off the entire plant using my hand to support every branch. 15 minutes later I put the cats back on the plant. I noticed several tiny eggs so I will not spray the bush anymore but instead, once a day, I use a cotton swab to rub off the aphids. It works well and the aphids are under control. There are still some on the plant but not as many as before which must have been in the hundreds. I am amazed to have at least 15 cats now on the plant. I have never seen a Monarch butterfly in my neighborhood before so this is truly special. I will continue to plant more milkweeds primarily native ones. My goal is to establish plants that will help pollinators in general but right now I am focused on Monarchs just because of all the cats on my one plant.

I didn't find any eggs. I think I missed them. Normally this time of year I leave them outside but a huge gully washer storm was coming in and I didn't want them all to drown. Checking the plants outside afterwards, I think about 1/2 of the remaining outside cats may have perished. Mother Nature can be tough. Seeing The cats initially was a surprise. Glad I did though! Was able to for sure save a bunch! I didn't even see the Monarchs come though! I guess just a few gals could have got the job done nicely.

Since May18-19, it has been pretty cold here in the 40s and low 50s and rainy or cloudy much of the time. Temperatures haven't reached 60 since then. Today, it was cloudy with temperatures around 50. I found some Monarch eggs May 20 after very warm days here around 80-85. I think this is when a Monarch was here. On May 27, the eggs still hadn't hatched and I took them inside where it was a little warmer and they hatched in a couple days. So they took 10-11 days to develop and hatch I estimate due to the cold weather. The Monarch caterpillar I found today is probably similar to the others in taking 10-11 days to hatch as I went out to check the milkweed today for any eggs I had missed or hoping to maybe find a caterpillar. I found this guy that seemed to had just hatched. So I'm writing this all down for scientific purposes. I'm just trying mainly to say that Monarch eggs take a much longer time to develop and hatch in cold weather.
