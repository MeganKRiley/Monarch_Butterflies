These nine were laid on only two plants, two of them on one leaf.  When I discovered so many in one day on these few plants I thought, if this was a random process, I would easily find several more in the park.

She flew over the fence and returned repeatedly.  Somehow, using  her Monarch radar, she managed to find the tiniest shoots of common milkweed -  about two inches high, on which she deposited some eggs.  There are at least a dozen eggs on this pathetic little patch of milkweed. How will these small stalks sustain  the little critters when they hatch? It seems to me the  milkweed is so slow emerging this year but since this is the first year I have anticipated its appearance, I cannot be sure that it is not right on time for this neck of the woods. Could the Monarch be early? I can only hope with sunshine, the latest rains and warmer temperatures, the milkweed demonstrates an enormous growth spurt in time to fee the hungry instars. I was tempted to bring them in and begin my Monarch project 2008, but I have nothing to feed them. So I will just watch and wait to see what Mother Nature has in store.

This is the earliest I&#39;ve ever seen a Monarch in northern New Jersey. Don&#39;t usually see them here until late June to early July. I don&#39;t have any flowers blooming yet as most of the perennials are just poking through the ground, never mind blooming, but the Common and Swamp Milkweed is up to about 10 inches tall, so I figured that she was probably there for one thing. As I worked on the car I kept noticing her fly by as she made circles around the house. Just before dark I decided to finally go through the Milkweed and immediately began finding eggs. She chose the smallest milkweed that just broke through the ground and in some cases she even moved the top leaves to place the eggs on the innermost leaves that were no more than an inch or less in size. She even left 2 eggs on a number of leaves. Total count for today was an amazing 60 eggs. Of the 60, only 3 were on Swamp and the remainder were on Common. These are numbers I don&#39;t usually see until mid July. The problem now is that I clipped each leaf and brought them all in the house because I wouldn&#39;t be able to live with myself if I didn&#39;t, and now I have to find enough milkweed to feed 60 hungry cats and who knows if she comes back tomorrow. If anyone in northern NJ is interested and has a supply of milkweed I&#39;d be thrilled to share some of the eggs, because 60 caterpillars are more than I can feed until my Milkweed begins to grow. This is the 1st time since I began rearing Monarchs in 2005 that I&#39;ll actually have Monarchs in the classroom in May and June, before school lets out.

I will be watching for leaf munching!The milkweed here  on our farm is mostly A. syriaca, when i reported my monarch sighting on 5/11, the milkweed was 12-16 inches tall. In past years,we have used those parts of the fields for organic vegetable production,but we have always left some milkweed for the monarchs. This year i am letting that section fill up with milkweed for butterflies in general and monarchs in particular.Also to collect seed for propagation.I am encouraging people to plant milkweed and other plants for nectar sources. Our farm is on top of a narrow ridge surrounded by hardwood forest. It never ceases to amaze me that monarchs have the ability to locate milkweed from the air. Every year i plant a 200 -300 foot row of zinnias just for bees,butterflies,hummingbirds and what ever else wants to partake.This year my goal is to have at least two of these rows and maybe a third.

This morning's excursion resulted in the discovery of 23 eggs, one yellow aphid and one lady bug from maybe 50-100 plants examined.  Most were single eggs per plant, but a few had two.  Most were on pristine leaves, but one was on a leaf damaged by hail about a week ago.  The milkweed is scattered in the grader ditch grassy area between the road and the farmer's fields (mostly 10-15 ft wide).  The milkweed is found along a length of about 3 miles north/south section road and a mile east/west.  The density of milkweed appears to be related to the timing and frequency of roadside mowing, which appears to be a somewhat random event among the farmers.  Herbicide spraying behavior is likely to another factor .   I gathered 12 of the eggs from areas I judged may be subject to mowing soon. This is close to the same number of eggs I found the whole season of the drought year 2012 when I raised and released 17 Monarchs.  2013 here started well, but the late season was poor due to no rain after the end of June.<p>Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9956844,-999999.999,1,Monarch Egg (FIRST sighted),0

I have over 100 plants of the common back by the barn in our back yard and also swamp milkweed and butterfly weed in my flower beds.

No tattering on wings just faded in color. I will monitor the eggs and young cats and hopefully bring them inside before predators find them. This was my second adult sighting(04/09/15) this season.

75831,1432583325,2015-05-21,Monarch Egg (FIRST sighted),1,39.002,-95.232,0,"While moving plants out of the greenhouse this morning, a familiar shadow passed by the open greenhouse door. I looked out the door to confirm my hunch and, sure enough, it was a female monarch that was moving among the potted and planted milkweeds on the south side of the greenhouse. She quickly disappeared but I did see her lay an egg. I returned to the greenhouse and continued moving plants. A few minutes later she flew through the open door directly to milkweeds that had yet to be moved and proceeded to go through egg-laying motions again. I decided to catch her but didn't have a net. I tried to catch her by hand but my clumsy attempt caused her to fly to the window. Fortunately, I was able to pin her to the window without injuring her. As you can see from the image, she is of medium size and quite fresh yet has a few scratches perhaps indicative of brushes with vegetation.This female, or perhaps another, was seen by several Master Gardeners who were working in the garden this morning. She was evidently attracted to, and laying eggs on, common milkweed. I'll have to look for eggs later.It's sunny but cool, only 62F.<p>Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2015/05/1432583325.jpg,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch Egg (FIRST sighted),0

I captured 2 minutes of video footage of monarch eggs on some tiny shoots of Asclepias fascicularis milkweed growing along a highway turnout The ground where these shoots had come up had been sprayed with herbicide a month or two earlier (before the shoots came up) so the milkweed escaped harm from the spraying.The likely overwintered female monarch that laid these eggs probably did so during the stretch of warm weather between March 9 - 18.  These eggs should produce a new generation of adults in 7-8 weeks (May 2 - 18) many of which will migrate north to the Pacific Northwest and east across the Great Basin.

Ann searched the same plants later - about 30 small plants with few leaves â€” and found another 25 eggs.Itâ€™s obvious that a lot of egg dumping is underway. Females with lots of eggs to lay are finding it hard to find milkweeds and apparently keep coming back to the same plants.At 4:15 I took a break and went on a search for emerging milkweeds myself and met up with a monarch female (my 4th of the day) who was conducting her own search. I followed her for about 80 yards before she disappeared. Her flight was strong and her search effort was intense and rapid. It was hard to keep up with her and eventually I couldnâ€™t.The most interesting observation was of a monarch using powered flight at a height of about 40â€™ at 1PM.

Watched her for ~15 minutes after returning from an errand and got some photos.  She was single-minded and busy, ignored all flowers, didn't stop to nectar. She flew low, would land on a leaf and if it wasn't a milkweed it was ""touch and go"" to the next plant, flying  vigorously.  When she'd find a milkweed sprout, she would either ""touch and go"" [maybe sensed she'd already laid an egg there?] or stop to lay an egg. She visited every single milkweed sprout [from less than 2 to more than 7 inches tall] she could find in the front.  I didn't check the back; she was gone for a little bit, I took some pix of eggs [she left one egg per stem so far], then she came back to look over the milkweeds again, touch and go or lay an egg.  I sat among the front sprouts with the camera and she pretty much ignored me, though a flash scared her up once.  Whether it was the mid-80 degree temps that motivated her or just ""my clock is ticking,"" it was GREAT to watch, my first springtime egg laying session.  If it ever happened before, I was never home to see it, and I don't remember any springtime cats.  Nearby weather data from the airport, ~10 mph W winds, ~50% sky cover, 48% rel humidity.

In some cases one of the Monarchs has been egg dumping today literally depositing multiple eggs on a leaf.  I've already found leaves with 7,5, 4, 3 and 2 eggs on them.  In many cases the eggs are being deposited on the newer, lowest, and smallest of plants in the yard.  Some of the leaves are so small I've had to use tweezers to pick them off of the plants as I raise them indoors because of the hazards including the ants, spiders and earwigs that are all waiting for their next Monarch meal.  The photo attached is a photo of one of the Monarchs taking a break to get a drink.

I thought with the late spring we had this year, they will arrive later this year. What a surprise!!! I will post in the egg section as well. By the way, by looking at the eggs, I noticed that they are too different colours. Some are more yellow, from my almost five years of experience with raising Monarchs, that tells me there were two females in the area, not just the one I saw! One milkweed had three eggs on it.

This morning I observed a monarch laying eggs on the common milkweed patch in the front but it flew away before I was able to catch a photo. This is very early in my observations in the same patch over the last five years. What stands out to me is that the common milkweed (A. syriaca) is actually still fresh enough for egg laying. Usually by the time adult monarchs arrive, the milkweed that is used for egg laying is swamp milkweed (A. incarnata) because the A. syriaca is too tough. This year the A. syriaca is still soft and half the height it is usually by the time the first monarchs arrive.Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9944685,-999999.999,1,Monarch Egg (FIRST sighted),0
