It rose high & vanished. In the grove clearing, monarchs dropped steadily thru the trees from north/northwest singly or grouped. Often overshoting the roost, they quickly circled back,searching. How quickly they realized they had missed & how quickly they homed in! Scent, vibration, sight? Landing, they turn into ""dead leaves"" almost immediately using the same tree as last nights monarchs! Arrivals continued for 30 minutes. There was much wing flashing from ""roosters"" to warn incoming of from coming too close. Early dark? Changing barometer?

They couldnot take flight; the winds were NNW at 20-25 mph with higher gusts. Anymonarch that relinquished hold on the flowers was immediately caught in thewind and blown out to sea. They will be trapped on the goldenrod flowers allday if the winds continue, and will have to survive the next two high tides,which are predicted to be even higher than this past one.

The raining seasons seems to be over now. Since yesterday, and after very cloudy, windy and rainy weeks, we have deep blue sky and sunny days. </B>We do have very icy cold mornings and evenings, though.<P><B>25 de octubre</B> <br>Apart from the two Monarchs we saw overflying our area last week, there are still no Monarchs arriving formally. Yesterday, Mr. Germán Medina came after a visit to ""El Cerrito."" El Cerrito is the first place we see the monarchs settle once they arrive to the region and before they go up to the Sanctuaries. He says that there are no Monarch there on the trees. We continue to have clouds and medium-heavy rain every as ""spectrum"" of hurricanes affecting the Pacific Coast. So it may still take some days before the monarchs appear.  <P>Next weekend, we are celebrating our Patron Saint in town ""San Simón"", it is a religious fest where processions, services and some live typical classical Mexican music (beautiful music) in the evenings take place. Firework, typical Mexican food and candies are sold too.  <P>Many, many years ago, when the town was founded (in the late 1600's --1690--), the mining town was not called Angangueo, but ""Real de San Simón"". Angangueo was an Hacienda about 5 km.away from town, and none knows when and why the name Real de San Simón disappeared and the name Angangueo was taken for both Hacienda and town. For us, the word ""Real"", is given to a mining place, town or village, and most of them from the ones existing in our country, take the name of a Catholic Saint after.  <P>Next week we will be celebrating our ""Death's Day"" which is a National Festivity. Then I will tell you about what I could get for you of this in town. In between I will make contact if there is any news of the Monarch's arrival. <P><B>23 de octubre</B><br>I was with Germán this morning asking him about any news of the monarchs' arrival, but he tells me that he thinks that there are still not an important amount arriving. However, I feel very anxious about it because the ""official date of arrival"" is almost here and other people also tell me that Monarchs are not yet here. So, Germán promised me that he would personally go to ""El Cerrito"", --where they settle on arriving-- and he will come and tell me tomorrow. I am sure there must be some groups already here, maybe not so numerous, because we've had inestable weather, in this moment, since yesterday, we are having a Hurricane passing by, after some days the last one had gone away, so for two or three days more it will be foggy, windy and rainy, which might delay arrival a little bit.

People directly involved in the butterfly season, are preparing themselves manufacturing crafts, a restaurant owner reopened his restaurant  one week ago, seems to be.

I have seen small adults that came from caterpillars that went into the chrysalis stage early, always because they had been captured and didn't have absolutely fresh leaves after that.

My friend Judy and her sister showed up after about half an hour (we'd agreed to meet there) and Judy had brought her tags, so Doug and I netted 25 and we tagged them. We could have netted hundreds if we'd been there all day and had enough tags.

They were also roosting in a few places on the big leaves of what looked like a frazer magnolia. When they had their wings closed it was almost impossible to see them but when a new one would approach, the ones that were already roosted would open and flutter  their wings, and then you could see the orange, and the movement. We estimated that there were hundreds, perhaps 1,000 (maybe more) monarchs roosted there when we left at 6 p.m. and there were still monarchs nectaring on the wildflowers (snakeroot, goldenrod and purple asters, with the snakeroot the favorite). It was a wonderful sight. There were so many flying around before they settled into the clusters that it looked the way it does around a beehive--just constant motion against a backdrop of trees.

There weren't a countless amount here, but I saw a pretty good small group of them! They all flew away before I could get any pictures :(  I think they are heading out of this area now.

It was not just a field but 1000 acres of CRP land (Conservation set-aside) in which the monarchs numbered in the thousands. In the email the text read """"hundreds of thousands"" monarchs on a 10 acre field of goldenrods. <B> The density is at least 100 monarchs per square meter</B>."" Given the email statement about 10 acres, I asked V three times about the size of the area and she assured me each time that it was a thousand acres. When I asked about the estimate of the number of monarchs, V told me that their <B>best guess is that 40-50 thousand monarchs were using the area at one time.</B><p>The monarchs arrived on Saturday the 7th and V and Carl have been making trips to the location each morning and evening since then. V gave this description of the exodus from the field each evening. <P>About 6:15 the monarchs begin to leave the flowers and head for the hedgerows to the north and east of the field. They do not appear to be using the hedgerow to the south (there are no trees to the west). Movement of the butterflies toward the trees accelerates by 6:30 and by 6:45 there is a virtual cloud of monarchs seeking places to roost in the trees - so much so that to observers they look like flocks of birds coming to roost. By 7PM all but a few of the monarchs are at rest in the trees.<P>This spectacle will probably end as a cold front moves through the area. The weather for tomorrow is expected to be in the low 60s with showers so the butterflies may not be able to leave the area until the skies clear and the temperature hit the low 60s on Friday.The Jeffers informed me that Jim Edson is on his way to the location so maybe Jim will be able to provide some clarifications and additional details.<P>There are two fields consists of about 1,000 acres of goldenrod, asters and a few other wildflowers. A drainage ditch with a tree line divided the fields. The monarchs were moving out of the fields to the trees by thethousands. I don't know how to estimate the numbers, but the tree line isabout 0.5 miles long and all of the trees were full of monarchs. I haven'tseen anything like it except in Mexico. There could have been anywhere from10K to 100K butterflies.This is the largest aggregation of migrating monarchs I've heard of in several years.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,-999999.999,1,Monarch Fall Roost,0

A local farmer called me approximately at noon and indicated that he had seen a huge amount of monarchs adjacent to a field in the Neosho river bottom. <B>I went to the location with the presumption that I might see a few hundred or even a few thousand monarchs. The population was much greater.</B> Obviously, I cannot give you an accurate amount or even a valid estimate. I do know that it was very large. The monarchs were located in a woods adjacent to a field of sunflowers that I would say was at least 400 acres. The sunflowers were in full bloom. The wood circles the entire field. In addition, there is a levee which is approximately 15 feet tall. <p>Sunday, we had a strong southerly breeze that was probably 20 to 30 miles per hour with stronger gusts. I don't know if the monarchs had congregated because of the nectar source, the strong southerly winds, and the protection provided by the woods and levees, or for some other reason. Regardless, it was one of those once in a lifetime experiences. Many were clinging to the leaves of the trees and many more were flying in the wood and the open fields to the North of the levee and tree line. As indicated, it would be impossible to estimate the total. As you probably now I have been to Sierra Chincua and Rosario. While these butterflies were not that dense, there certainly was a large concentration. <B>I know at least in the tens of thousands. </B>I followed the tree line around the sunflower field for approximately ï¿½ mile in both directions and the concentration seemed to be uniformed the whole 1 mile distance. Many of the trees had a dense concentration of butterflies. The butterflies were not hanging from each other in a curtain effect but they were dense. The trees located right on the levees did not exceed15 to 20 feet in height.<p>While my amateur observation may be incorrect the butterflies appeared to me to be in fairly good shape overall. They appeared to have fairly plump bodies, fairly large wing spans, and overall there wings appeared to be in fairly good shape. Quite frankly, I was a little worried at least about the monarch local population. I did not have nearly as many caterpillars this year in my Waystation stations as last year. I was hopeful that this was due to the fact that we have had lots of rain and lots of wildflowers so they were not concentrating on flower gardens as much. Regardless of that issue, I certainly saw a huge amount of monarchs yesterday. I don't know how long they have been there or how long they will be staying.

Yesterday morning (10/24/07) just as the sun was first hitting my yard, I walked along the outer edge, checking butterflies that might be sunning. The trees and high shrubs contained 120 to 150 Monarchs, most perched with wings spread, warming their bodies. Very few other butterflies were active that early. Within a half hour or so the Monarchs begin to move to my numerous crucitas shrubs (Eupatorium odoratum) to feed. At any one time I could see 25-30 individuals close together on a couple sunny sites. Within the next couple hours they began moving about, sampling nectar on my numerous crucitas and/or white mistflower shrubs (Epatorium wrightii); few also utilizing duranta shrubs. This action continued until about noon. Gradually, apparently after adequately feeding, individuals began to move off, all seemingly heading southward, some fly low but most 20 to 50 feet above the ground. This southward movement continued for much of the afternoon. But more individuals appeared from the north, flying over the adjacent treeline to drop into my yard to feed. It seemed that at no time all day did I have less than 100 (est) individuals visible at any time. By late afternoon, with the sun still highlighting a number of crucitas, feeding activity continued at a high pitch. It seemed that fewer individuals were moving off; the vast majority of the activity was centered around the sunny patches of crucitas. During the last ten years that I have been paying attention to my yard butterflies, yesterday's Monarch numbers represented an all-time high. I will repeat my visits again today.

On the causeway, my wife Altus said there were more monarchs than she had ever seen. Fantastic numbers between 2-4 pm falling out in the area.  I started out across the causeway when I went back and counted 89 monarchs coming at me in the first mile and then just quit counting. We saw clusters forming up on everything that could support monarchs, starting about 3:30.  Some clusters two to threehundred and still growing.  You couldn't drive along the beach road at more than a crawl because of the cloud of monarchs in the grass and dead sunflowers along the edge.  Some snapshots from earlier in the afternoon that just didn't do justice to the event!  Salt cedar and false willow are both blooming. Some queens in the clusters, to be expected, but I could see some buckeyes in with the monarchs ... not sure about that!One of my ex-students with TxDOT stopped by at the causeway to be see if I was over there or he was going to call me to tell me the monarchs had arrived. The wind really stiffened from the NW after 1:00 and is out of the NE right now, not sure what that means for tomorrow. At least we had two great days.<B>October 25</B>Flow continues&hellip;Best hourly avg 800+. Best 5 min 331 at 1:30Really large cluster/roost. The morning warmup took quite awhile and new arrivals were there before yesterday's crowd wanted to go. By noon it was a parade of monarchs coming by and over. The times I went across the causeway I wondered why there wasn't a wreck.  There would be what I would estimate to be a hundred monarchs in a space the size of my bedroom enjoying a pillow of air.  I've only seen it like this one other time ... Some really nice clusters/roosts formed just before sundown.Altus is really good when it comes to spotting a large amount of orange!  Not sure why most had their wings open, just did.Biggest cluster we have ever seen, in the middle of a ""round"", formed by mostly salt cedar, a couple of mesquite, and a hackberry ... that amphitheatre we always hear that they will find ...The wind is changing and so may be the fun, may be one more day ... <B>October 26</B>Early liftoff of clusters ... area cleared before 8:00 but new flow had already opened.  Best count so far 12:00 to 12:30: half hour of 1,156 for hourly of 2,312. Best 1 minute count was 43. Best count crossing the 3.1 mile causeway, 194 in 5 minutes. It was like this at 8:00 and was getting better at 12:00, the calm wind may make a difference this afternoon. Same location near TX35, Alcoa Bluff, and north end of peninsula to Lavaca Bay Causeway, ... same place, same way as last year.I can see a width of about 300' and an altitude about 200'. I crossed over to west side and got into the stream ... they were coming from 65 deg and leaving out across the bay to245 deg.  I could see twenty coming and twenty lined up out across the bay.  Checked with binoculars, there are a few above 200', the most action is in the lower 100' and I can see that without binocs.  Many other butterflies showing up today now that it is calm.  Calm, slight whisper out of NW, 76 dF, 18 % humidity, deep clear sky.  This is all about to change. Wind switched from NNW to NNE to E then to SE between 3:30 and 4:30 and the monarchs went away on the east side of the peninsula.  There was still a river of monarchs coming off Alcoa bluff, crossing TX 35, and going down the west side. Altus drove over there just before sundown and found that the monarchs were heading across the bay and then returning ... clusters started forming on the west of almost every tree/shrub along the high tide line as far as she could drive.  *We went back after dark and the clusters were the largest in size and coverage we had ever seen. * We only drove along about half a mile of the shell road but the clusters kept going on trees/scrubs back towards Point Comfort. Next front Monday, couldn't be any better? <B>October 27</B>With the wind turning turning more to the NNE and then NE the monarchs have slowed down or are somewhere's else. Liftoff of the clusters started about sunup this morning and was finished by 8:30. Best hour flyby would avg to 250. Best drive across the causeway/peninsula was a count of 50.

There were several others still milling around so the sighting was a dozen or less in all. The roost was too high in the tree to take pictures which was also unusual since they usually roost about 15 feet above the ground.<p><B>August 29</B><br>We saw our first small roost of about 30 monarchs on Friday, August 29. I walked around the farm grove that day looking for them in trees where they normally roost but didn't see any more.<P>I believe they stuck around for several days since we have had a strong south wind which would be unfavorable for their trek south. I just went out to check them again and they are still here today, September 2. At around noon today the wind switched from the south to the west and they seemed to be in the process of moving to a more secluded spot out of the wind. I would guess there were somewhere around 100 of them flying around near the maple trees. I did see one small roost of them, perhaps 20 in number.<P>I saw quite a bunch of them when I mowed the lawn yesterday (September 1). I took pictures that night.  I believe it was the first bunch we saw Aug. 29 since they were in the same tree and on the same branch. Here is a picture of one roost where I count 39 or 40 Monarchs.

The second bunch was smaller than the one in the attached picture as my pictures just didn't turn out on that one. They were about 15 feet up in the tree.  With the slight breeze and fog I got only a very blurry picture of the smaller bunch but did ok on the other one.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Fall_roostBWinter02.jpg""><p><B>August 19</B><br>I haven't seen anything that looked like migration.

It is 46 degrees on my back porch, as of 6 a.m., so I think I can get out and check my own trees before the snakes start stirring.<P>Apparently our overnight low temp. (42 degrees) kept the monarchs hanging in their trees for a few hours this morning until it warmed up. I didn't see any the first hour or so after sunrise, but finally began seeing some activity....monarchs coming up out of the crowns of the trees where they'd probably roosted overnight.<P><B>9:30 a.m</B><br>By 9:30 a.m., they were leaving the trees, nectaring in the pastures (and our yard and garden!), and flying southwestward. For about a half hour, I saw them at the astonishing (for me!) rate of 25 to 50 per minute (or maybe even a little more). At that point it was about 55 degrees, no wind, endless visability except for low fog banks over parts of the Red River. They stayed low, nectaring, as they flew towards the southwest. That lasted 20 or 25 minutes, and then it dropped to about 10 to 15 per minute. <P><B>11 a.m.</B><br>By 11 a.m., the temperature was up to about 60 degrees, still great visability and no wind. I guess most of the monarchs were flying high by then, because I was only seing 1 to 5 per minute.<P>So, a pretty good start to the day.

Hoy (29 de Octubre), pudimos observar al rededor de 10 ï¿½rboles cubiertos en sus copas y dozenas, quizï¿½s cientos de mariposas volando en la periferia, tuvimos un dï¿½a cï¿½lido y soleado. Pero el Lunes y Martes, hubo viento muy fuerte y frï¿½o. Por aï¿½os, al menos hasta donde yo recuerdo, nunca habï¿½amos tenido este viento con frï¿½o polar y con esta intensidad en Angangueo. Tuvimos pequeï¿½os accidentes en el pueblo debido a ello, como por ejemplo las lï¿½minas de los techos de algunas casas que el viento derribï¿½. Pero en nuestro vecino pueblo de Ocampo, las noticias a nivel nacional informaron de fuertes brazos de ï¿½rboles quebrados debido a la intensidad del viento!. Este temporal es tï¿½pico del mes de Octubre en la region, pero nunca se habï¿½a visto que se repitiera en dos ocaciones tan seguidas ni con tanta agresividad.  Asi pues, la temporada de Mariposa ha comenzado en Angangueo. Espero poder escribir un reporte en el fin de semana para informarles del incremento de mariposas vistas.  <br>Mucho cariï¿½o desde nuestro pequeï¿½o pueblo.  <br>Maria Estela Romero</font> </div>",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,100000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Mr. Germï¿½n Medina was at El Rosario today with some tourists and they saw around 15 trees mostly full at the top. Days ago, a woman from La Salud (the community on the approach to El Rosario) told me that there were already some Monarchs at El Llano de los Conejos (a meadow inside the sanctuary). So, now we can say that Sanctuaries are ready to start to be open. The official date to inaugurate their access to the public should be around November 17-20. (The tourists were allowed to access the Sanctuary, although they have not been officially opened.)<br>Many, many greetings from Angangueo,<br>Estela Romero<br><P> Editor's Note: We are only estimating the date of first roost in El Rosario here as October 31st, since the woman at La Salud noted monarchs in the sanctuary ""a few days ago"" (as of Nov. 2nd when this report from Estela was written).

Lots passed by before that, flying as always due south, one by one, but suddenly as the sun got lower, they started to communicate in a way, searching for their fellow monarchs, and congretated at a few selected larger oak trees inside the park.  They sat down, as on the picture, on the west side of the trees, meaning that the morning sun would not reach them.  And more an more kept joining in getting ready for the night.  The sun sets at 6 pm here now.  It is cold at night, down to 2-3 degrees in the national park mentioned as it is at a considerable altitude of 2600m.  The city of Queretaro is at 1900m.  You can see some pictures from the park here: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_Joya_La_Barreta  <p>Upon leaving the park, we saw this eucaluptus from the picture standing tall in the evening sun loaded with monarchs.  It is obvious that they search for the tallest trees.<p>In and around the city we have had 3 days now (Oct 31-Nov 2)with large amounts of monarchs, yesterday evening a friend observed groups roosting in trees outside his office window downtown.

Many years that number could have been 500.</B> Have not yet tagged a monarch. Have observed no roosts, as so few around ( but generally the hard migration wouldn't have started here yet.) Usually lots of building of local monarchs August 1- 23 or so, then hard migration somewhere around August 23 - September 1. <P>I raise most of my Liatris lig as kind of a biannual as some kind of insect eats the heck out of the leaves as it emerges in the spring, so I start all in pots from seed, keep it growing in pots all summer, then transplant to my annual beds the next spring. Lots of work but we have to adapt just as the pests have adapted to my unnatural abundance of these plants. <P>To put it bluntly lowest ever numbers here. Somewhat hopeful that numbers might increase to average as the migration moves through. An awful lot would have to change in the next 7 to 10 days to even get up to average here.

I was on the phone at the time and just idly watched them as I chatted.  Then I noted them landing on one of my trees.  The area where they landed looked odd to me so I stepped out onto my deck to take a closer look.  Imagine my surprise and delight when I realized that the odd shading on the tree was actually dozens of monarch butterflies that had landed and were perched on one of the branches.  As I ventured closer, I realized that two of the branches of the tree were just loaded with monarchs.  It was a blustery and rainy day here so I think they were landing here to dry.  I grabbed my camera and started taking photos.  I hit the video option on the camera when more monarchs came and landed to rest with the rest of the group.  When a new one would land, the others would gently flap their wings, as if to say ""welcome"".  As I watched, another half a dozen of them came and landed, one at a time.  What an amazing sight.  It's too dark now to really be able to see them well.  I hope they are still there in the morning so I can see them in full daylight.<p>I am located in a neighborhood.  My yard is lined totally with large trees and the entire neighborhood is full of large trees.  Many of them are over 20 years old so the big ones are not in short supply at all.  If I am remembering right, the wind was from the north.  It had been raining on and off all day so everything was very wet.  The monarchs were on the south side of the tree.  I do believe they were taking shelter and trying to get dried out.  It was so cool when one would land, the others would gently flap their wings as though saying ""Hello, what took you so long"".  There are some agricultural fields nearby - probably within a mile or so.  They are mostly corn and some peas and beans.  I don't think we have alfalfa fields nearby but I cannot say for sure.  <P>Editor&rsquo;s Note: We are estimating a minimum of 24 monarchs based on observer&rsquo;s comment about &ldquo;dozens of monarchs.&rdquo;<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Roost_KPflepsen01.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Roost_KPflepsen02.jpg""><p>they moved on to their next roosting spot.

Diving and swooping, I tried to photograph them, but to no avail, they were just too fast! I finally video taped them in one on there dances on the trees as they landed. In a high roost over my head I watched as 20 bright wings tried to land on the same branch. A little humming bird confused by this color,flew towards them. I saw him dip his little head at them, and he flew of onto the trail. A good day to be alive!<p><B>August 23</B><br>Today at Padua more migrating Monarch's.

The clusters were all of similar size, 12-15 butterflies per cluster.  There were very likely lots of singles and doubles, too.  Early on I saw a lot of these in the smaller isolated trees, but they may have moved and clustered as darkness came on.  The alfalfa blooms were more fully developed than last Friday.  I suspect these Monarchs were different than the ones I saw then because Saturday was a blue sky/northern breeze day and I didn't observe many Monarchs in the alfalfa Saturday morning. Tom Murphy  (of Cannon Falls) and I discussed roosting conditions a lot on Sunday.  I agree with him that a good NECTAR SOURCE is the most important thing.  Also look for LARGE nectar sources, preferably up high (ridges, plateaus), with a tree or trees close by.  And look for still nights with temperatures that drop quickly into the 50s.  When it was warmer, the air around the lower trees cooled off a few degrees more.  That was a factor Sunday evening.  When the wind blows from the north, they will likely be gone.  Catch them when you can.  ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9936645,45.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Bottom line is, I saw a wonderful Monarch roost form this evening, two miles east of East Farmington, WI. The roost was about 40 Monarchs that formed in a tree standing with a few others in an unplowed clump the size of a small yard.......located near the northern edge of a 40 acre ripe alfalfa field.Using binoculars to look halfway across the sunlit field, I first saw a single butterfly go towards the clump of trees and disappear.  Then I spotted another Monarch, and yet another.  I was able to follow the third one into the tree where the roost was developing, and from 300 yards away, I saw the burst of orange in the sunlight as the new Monarch entered the cluster and they fluttered their wings as they do.I knew instantly that it was a cluster.The farmer who was cutting and raking the alfalfa was nearby, and I was able to signal his attention.  He stopped and I ran across the field to him, got permission to go over to the clump of trees (and found out, luckily, that he wasn't going to cut over there this evening).About five minutes later, I was there.  The wind was strong, but the light was wonderful.  It was still early in the evening with a cold night coming on hard.  I videotaped and took still pictures until sunset.  Don't know if I'll see another roost this year, but that one will do me.What an hour of joy.Wish you could have been there.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Fall_roostpswerkstroms01LG.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Fall_roostpswerkstroms02LG.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Fall_roostpswerkstroms03LG.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/Fall_roostpswerkstroms04LG.jpg"">",-999999.999,99.0,-999999.999,9936645,40.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I did not think they ever flew at night but, if not, they must have left at the first crack of dawn, since at 7:00, it is barely light right now and was a cloudy day anyway. Today was a very cool (60 degrees) and even windier at dawn, so maybe they figured they better head on south?

Once we spotted the first group - the largest - we looked for more and found at least five more trees with large concentrations in them.  The one we photographed (not the largest) was closest to the dam; Greg eventually walked all around it, and we estimated there were 3,500 - 4,000 individuals in that one tree.  Interestingly, at one point a strong gust seemed to dislodge a number of Monarchs - it looked like 700 - 1,000 flew up in a blizzard and worked their way down to other sheltered spots - but looking back at the tree they had just left, we could not see any discernible reduction in the number of monarchs!  It got slightly warmer, and a small number of individuals left each cluster but when we left the dam the majority were still in-place. At the north end of the dam there was a line of Salt Cedars that could have had more monarchs, but the lee side was away from us so we could not tell.

I make the entry to establish this information:  the temperature was falling from 70 towards 60, but only reached 64 by dark.  I think that fact was crucial in the lack of a good roost.  The wind was calm, and the wind had been mostly south for the past week, allowing the butterflies to accumulate and feed extensively.  A factor working against roosting on our back hills are the absence of dominant trees......the entire pasture area of some 60+ unfarmed acreage is surrounded and partly overgrown with smaller trees.  The presence of so much wooded area around their feeding area tends to encourage the butterflies to enter the woods in many varied places.  But I'll keep trying.<p><B>August 24</B><br>Had a successful search for roosting Monarchs tonight (August 24th). The wind was westerly today and so most of our Monarchs held. Temperatures were falling from 70 degrees at about 6:00 to 60 degrees when I got home at 8:00 or 8:30.  We ended up getting morning temperatures in the low 50s (about 53 for a low at home, and 55 at 7:30 a.m.) Monarch clustering is a very good indication of temps falling below 60 degrees. (Tom Murphy told me last year that he thinks 57 or 55 is the magic number for monarch clustering behavior.)<P>The Monarchs at the alfalfa field I found yesterday (August 23rd) were done feeding by 6:30.  I saw only three butterflies when I walked across the partially cut alfalfa.  In fact, I thought maybe the whole bunch had migrated.  Then I started to see scattered Monarchs along the wood edge that borders the field, but only ones and twos.....nothing resembling a roost except for three or four that fluttered around one tree.  I walked to the corner of the field, where it was much lower ground, and there I found a small cluster of maybe five, but they spooked--at least that's what I thought. <P>  I continued walking the edge of the field, videotaping singles and doubles along the tree edge, mostly silhouette shots as they searched for roosting spots.  I found one more small bunch fluttering around the east end, but the sun was setting and so I decided to retrace my steps and check the two earlier possible roost sites.  <P>It was lucky I did.  The corner low spot was now a good roost and getting better with each minute.  I taped it for about 15 minutes and when I was just about to leave the group became very agitated and there was a swarming effect as they left their roosts and returned again and again.  It was quite amazing.  Much like watching a swarm of bees. The roost was the largest I have seen.......I'm guessing there were six dozen or so, maybe more.   Before it got completely dark, I hiked back to the earliest spot I had hopes for, out near the road.  I had about given up on finding anything when I saw a fluttering in the last main tree on the fencerow.  There turned out to be three clusters there......I'm guessing 50-75 butterflies > between them all. Counting all thebutterflies I saw walking the field edges, I'm guessing there must have been 200 or more on Bill Thiel's alfalfa field.  (Thanks for sharing, Bill!) To cap the evening off, a full moon was rising as I walked back to the car.What a night.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9936645,275.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Tobermory is at the tip of the Bruce Penninsula surrounded by the waters of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.  The clusters were anywhere from head height to about 30 feet up in white cedar, black spruce, balsam fir and white birch trees.  We visited the roost at about 8 pm - it was 20 degrees C, 95% RH (it had rained earlier) with winds from the WSW.  Other cottagers had reported seeing the roosting monarchs a day or two prior.

On the way out to Padua, I didn't spot any flying in a southerly direction from Sauk Centre.    At. 6:30  noticed about 25 or more flying over my head and towards a sunlit maple tree.  It was cool 61% and no wind.  As I continued t o watch I saw  about 15 little roosts in the sun with about 8-9 little Monarch's per roost.  I continued to watch, and more little roosts were forming in the sheltered woods.  No feeding was observed, but the came within 6 - inches over my head in a fly by.   Left at around 7:30 with the little roosts increasing their numbers to about 10 -15  or more per roost. The roosts were beginning to spread out as I left.<p><B>September 3</B><br>Came out to Padua at 1:40PM, today.  Looked for Monarch roosts.Gone!  Happy and sad at the same time. They were on their way.As I called to them just 1 lone Monarch flew over my head.Checked the little woods, willow tree, pine trees, no Monarchs to be seen.Checked the corn fields, and flower beds, not a one.  At 6PM tonight I walked to my car, and a Monarch flew 10 inches from my head and then turned into the Pine trees.  Then 2-3 flew over my head heading for the Pine tree.  Out of no where, they came to gather again. at least 30+ over my head and landing in cotton wood, pine, and maple leaf trees. Watched for over an hour, seeing their Little roost, grow to at least 60.  Happy to see them again, I bid them good night, watching them in my rear view mirror as I left Padua.<p><B>September 2</B><br>Sad news today, after a terrible wind and hail storm, I found shredded wings and bodies of little Monarch's on the ground. We had high wind and hail, and it hit the roosts pretty hard.  I started to cry when I saw all the little bodies, and shredded wings. To see so many roosts, and then this devastation. The roosts were about 400 or 500.  When I called to them from the Pine and willow trees about 30 flew over my head.  Some  person one called me at 8am from Padua, and didn't see any roosts.  There were downed branches,and torn willow leaves every where. I marked where each little set of wings were with twigs.  I then started to collect them in a bag.  At least 50 wings, I had to stop collecting them it was too sad. The wind still strong was picking them up and blowing them away.   At. 1Pm I was happy to see they were coming out of the woods, and across the fields.and again roosted in the elm,willow, and pine trees.   At around 2 Pm. we had another tremendous down pour.  I noticed that the had started to gather in large roosts at about 1:30 on the elm trees.   A half hour later the big storm hit.  They were there tonight when I left  7:30, still huddled together.Hope tomorrow is a better day.  Never want to see broken, shattered Monarch's bodies again.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/monarch_wings_j_finley_lg.jpg""><p><B>September 1</B><br>Tonight spotted  roosts in little woods of about 300 or so, they had increased there numbers. At 10:30 am went out to little woods and called Monarch's. They had moved from Pine tree roost, back to the little sheltered wood. 100 or so flying back and forth over my head. 1 PM Went out to water our our prairie flowers and noticed Monarch's feeding.  I know that they like fresh water, so as I was watering some of the flowers, I sprayed the grass heavily in one area so they could have a little drink.  Several fly overs dropped down to get a drink on the dew dropped grass.  When I went back to the little wood and called them 10 flew over and circled around me.At 5 PM I went down the little road in amongst the trees at Padua.I was starting to see about 25 or so little roosts with 10 to 15 per branch, to little roosts of 50 or more amongst the cotton wood, maple, elm, willow, and crab apple trees. They were flying back and forth still feeding on the corn tassels,flowers, Scottish thistle, and other flowering plants I couldn't identify.  7PM night roost started in earnest. The branches on several of the trees had so many on their branches they started to bend with the weight of them.  <B>Stood and counted 25 roosts, there were at least 2,000 Monarch, little woods, another 1,000 in the little lane leading through the woods.</B> I feel this the last time I will see so many of my beautiful friends this year.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_j_finley_01.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_j_finley_02.jpg""><p><B>August 31</B><br>Have two observations for today.   First roost sightings were about 5 Pm counted about 10 roosts of over a hundred in the little North East woods.    The second roosting 7 PM  at least 200 patterns were at the end of the trees with huge roosts in the flowing willow trees. They had moved from their little snug amongst the pine trees of Padua. 300 per roost in some of them.As I walked amongst their many roosts, they were increasing in numbers.  Amongst the roosts, willow, cotton wood, elm, crab apple, ceder trees, pine trees, and some maple.  I walked them all, taking movies of them in their bright orange fireball displays on landings.  As I continued to photograph them the sun started to set. Beautiful orange butterfly's against an orange butter cream sky, with beautiful pink spun candy floss sky's as it set. Another beautiful day at Padua<p><B>August 27</B><br>Today as I continued with my fact finding for the migration of Monarch's, at Padua, I decided to try a  different time frame. At 4: 00 pm, I decided to check the roosts for any change in the preferences for  roosting.  I noticed that the day before they came out of the woods when I called them.  They also had moved to the N.E.  side of the pine trees, close to the corn fields.   I noted at least 5 roosts of about 50 to 100 Monarch's,  in the first 5 or 6 trees.  I had to be careful walking around them, didn't want them to fly before I could count them.   As I started my count, and notations, one of my new friends from Ireland asked for help in spotting my beautiful friends.   I called to them and a few flew out from the little woods, but she wanted to see more of them.   I told her to follow me to where I had last seen them the day before.  I could see them from the little wood location. As we walked to the Pine tree roosts, she was delighted when they flew over her head.  She then proceeded to walk up to the roost, and picked up a Monarch with her fingers, held it ,talked to it and put it back on the pine needles.   She did this 3 times!    I had never seen anyone handle one with such ability, and then put it back on the same branch she got it from.   She then asked some of her other friends from Ireland to come join her, so they could rejoice in God's beautiful  creation.     I came back later that night, again changing times 8:00 PM and found 4 more new roosts. A wonderful day! <p><B>August 27</B><br>Yesterday on the 26th of August, spotted many roosts in the morning. AT Noon , spotted at least 5 small roosts of about25 each.I noticed in the back of Padua, around the Pine tree line much activity. The Monarch's were flying over the corn field near them and landing in the Pine trees.  I counted about 250  or more in each level of about 5 trees.  It was quite windy, and they clinging to the pine needles. At 3PM  their numbers increased.I walked back to the area of Pines, as I walked toward the trees, a huge roost flew over my head, a firestorm of color.  The back woods were too filled with large roosts.  At 5 PM., the first roosts for the evening was starting on the trees facing the road. The roosts were again starting on the bare tree limbs of the little deep woods.  Some roosting in the beautiful bright sun,and the others harder to see in the deep shadow of the woods.6:30 PM   more roosts flying into the pine trees.  They hadn't stated the swarm on the cotton wood tree I had observed night before. I left Padua around 7:Pm, to another area a mile away.There observed several Monarch's flying toward the spot I had just left. <p><B>August 25</B><br>Yesterday and today (the 24th and 25th of August) I met my little friends again.  As they flew over my head my heart rejoiced to see their winged splendor.   I told friend from Ireland about the wonderful habit of the Monarch's roosting at certain spots before nightfall. Later that day I called to them down the path, and they flew over me, in a beautiful swooping greeting.  Later on that night around  8:30 pm., the visitors from Ireland came out to see the night roost.  I shared with one of them that the Monarch's are hard to see with wings folded. They look like dead leaves, and unless they move their wings you can't see their beautiful color. They were delighted at this special gift of Padua, Monarch's, and took photos also.More tomorrow  Judith of Padua",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9935014,3000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I took multiple pictures scanning the tree, then came home and counted them!    I observed that there was little feeding activity (between 4-5 p.m. today) but I was looking for the roosts and was watching for the odd butterfly in the air.  Besides the one large roost, there was another smaller one just west of the main one and then I noticed another higher up and further back (only because I saw them all ""flash"" at the same time).  We also have a small roost just behind the house as well. I estimate there to be at least 650 butterflies that I could see - approx. 500 in the largest roost - it's hard to see exactly how many there are when they are clustered close together, so I under estimated if I wasn't sure.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_1283994760_02.jpg""><p><B>September 9</B><br>I believe they have been attracted to our property because we have hay fields out back that, due to trouble with our hay cutting equipment, we haven't got cut yet.  Therefore, there has been lots of milkweed, alfalfa, clover and goldenrod to feed on.  The roost seems to be spread out across the back (and who knows where else).  I walk the dogs around a 40 acre parcel of land that consists of forested areas and open hay fields.<p> I've seen Monarchs over the past week - I'd say usually a dozen at a time, fluttering through the forest as I walk the dogs, which is something that I found unusual (been here 10 years and never seen this).  I keep disrupting Monarchs as I walk and usually see anywhere from 10 to 20 in a ""cloud"" fluttering around as I go, but then they settle elsewhere.  It wasn't until the last couple of days that I discovered the Monarchs roosting in the (mostly maple) trees at the far back of the property and realized that we were on a migratory path.  It's nicely sheltered from the wind, next to the goldenrod and hay fields.       <p>So, the question is ""how many are there?"" - I would estimate that I've seen at least 100 butterflies on my walks around the perimeter of the property (that I disturb), but that doesn't account for the ones that are hanging in the trees elsewhere in the forested areas (that I haven't ventured into).  I have noticed today less than yesterday - perhaps because of the colder, windy weather with temperatures around 15 C.  Could be they've gone deeper into the forest, higher in the trees?  or flown off?  Do they all go together at the same time?  Seems like less activity in the colder weather. <p>My best guess at numbers is ""hundreds"".  This is just one small patch in a tree (hanging on in the wind!).

We chose to stay at a campground on Friday night&nbsp;just about 10 miles east of&nbsp;PP along the northern rim of Lake Erie, 5 miles east of Wheatley. Imagine my excitement as we drove through dozens on them flying over us on the highway as we approached the campground.&nbsp;As the&nbsp;campground staff showed us our tent site, we saw monarchs roosting nearby in a tree. Then another roost in another tree!&nbsp;Most of the campground was a nice flat grassland but the tall mature trees had several branches layered in monarchs!&nbsp;I think we&nbsp;saw at least 6 roosting spots, with monarch numbers between 3-4 dozen to hundreds - depending on the tree.&nbsp;I stood below them netting and tagging the few that dared to fly low enough for me to get them. About 98% of them stayed above 15' so they were too high up to net. I'm only just over 5' and my net pole is about 6' - I'm getting an extension handle next year! I even&nbsp;used a picnic table to elevate myself - a fruitless attempt to net more. This must have completely amused the other campers. Thank goodness there were only a few of them, the campground wasn't busy. &nbsp;I estimate we saw 1000 (conservatively) to 2000 (!) at this campground Sept 17.&nbsp;Saturday morning&nbsp;we awoke to partly cloudy skies and the same strong wind blowing from the W - SW which was the opposite direction the monarchs wanted to fly. When the sun broke, many left the trees to nectar on pink field clover so we were able to net more. And for about 2 hours, more and more monarchs trickled in from the east and set up on the trees. I looked eastward and did NOT see any flying toward Pointe Pelee over the adjacent soybean field, The winds were too strong for them to fight it. So if you add the 2000 at Wheatley to the 2000 at Pointe Pelee (reported by park staff), those are good numbers. &nbsp;<p><B>September 16</B><br>Well.....I guess they were in a hurry and headed south.

Since Sunday, we have had about 100 monarchs flying around ten acres of red clover during the day and roosting each night in three distinct, tight, clusters on big maple trees 75 metres from our front door -- always on exactly the same branches, same leaves.  During one cold, wet, and windy day they did not move, and spent about 36 hours on their roost. This roost gives shelter from the fierce west winds that blew hard for a couple of days.<p>Yesterday (9/8), after a breezy cool day with occasional showers and long sunny periods (during which they were feeding in the clover) they started heading for the roost around 5pm. Again, same branches, same leaves. This morning (Thursday) when the temperature reached about 15 degrees around 10 am, they began leaving the roost. And tonight they are gone. They appear to have moved on, perhaps because of todayï¿½s light favourable winds.<p>We did manage to record some of this -- about three hours of HD video and 300 stills. Some wonderful slow motion shots as they all open and close their wings on the roost as each new arrival checks in. <B>It looks like the Wave at a football game.</B><p>This has been an exceptional year for monarch caterpillars. We have lots of milkweeds on the farm, but the monarchs laid their eggs mostly on isolated or sheltered milkweeds (under our main window for example) and avoided the dense stands of milkweeds in thick grasses. Do they know that a caterpillar would have a difficult time moving through thick grasses in search of a place to pupate....? Many were laid on milkweeds growing in bare earth on the fire break surrounding our tall grass prairie.<p>Every chrysalis we have found has been at least a metre away from the original milkweed, and none on the actual milkweed that fed them. There were about a dozen under the eaves of our house, some still there. At the pond, the butterflies show a strong preference for swamp milkweed, and the caterpillar moves to an adjacent plant to pupate. We had to rescue a few caterpillars that were on milkweed plants standing in water.<p>The real test of monarch mysteries will be next season. Will monarchs use the same roosts on the same branches in our maples? If so, who told them? Actually, we think that the two fields of red cover held them here. All of our neighbours&rsquo; fields yielded an unusual third cut of hay this summer and are now bare with no flowers. The two fields west of our cabin were spared when our neighbour, who cuts the hay, had a mechanical problem.

Their predecessors two weeks before, where hundreds of monarchs roosted on one pine tree, today there were 10 -40 on a tree, but many more trees.On the next day I only spotted 30 over a 5 hour period.

With the rising sun, their flight muscles warmed and they lifted off. Feeling the tug of a strong west wind, they surrendered to it and found themselves sailing over Chesapeake Bay. Some glided just above the car rooftops on the eastbound lanes of the 4-mile bay bridge; others soared over the white-capped waves. They weren't alone. Their fellow travelers-- common buckeyes and green darners rode the same wind. They made landfall at Terrapin Park on the eastern shore. The monarchs drifted over the sand, through the Spartina and Phragmites, over the freshwater ponds to the fields. The wind was perfumed with the seductive scent of tickseed sunflower. Masses of golden flowers lured monarchs down into the fields by the hundreds. By mid-morning the wind picked up to 15-20mph. By late afternoon, monarch numbers had increased to several thousand. Standing amidst of this dance of swirling orange wings and gold petals, I felt infused with energy.<p>I also felt grateful for being able to witness this scene and knew that it would not have been possible without the managed fields. The fields were planted and are maintained by the Anne Arundel County Parks Dept. They could have kept this area as mowed grass for visitors to play frisbee on. Instead they put in the time/effort to create a habitat-- an old field stage of succession with an emphasis on native warm-season grasses. (They will be praised for their work). The fields are rich with common milkweed and butterfly weed, along with dozens of butterfly nectar sources, including several species of goldenrods and New England aster, which were also in peak bloom. <P>Editor&rsquo;s Note: We are estimating 3000 monarchs based on observer&rsquo;s estimate of &ldquo;several thousand.&rdquo;<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,3000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

They roosted in the Solidago sempervirens (seaside goldenrod) along the beach and in the wet meadows of Bidens laevis (large bur-marigold) along the wash flats road. At first light this morning there was a 15mph NW wind so the monarchs took flight. They migrated down the beach about 3 per minute (not big numbers but the flight was constant for a few hours). By late afternoon, winds were from the East and pushed the monarchs back to the Delmarva Peninsula.  <p>Although recent storms caused beach erosion and overwash of the interdune area along Tom's Cove, most of the seaside goldenrod that we planted this past spring survived. The monarchs spent the day on Friday nectaring on it, and then started roosting on it at 6pm. Today we planted 300 seaside goldenrod plants to stabilize a dune and provide more nectar at a critical monarch stopover point. Planting will continue along Tom's Cove during the next week as weather permits.<P>Editor&rsquo;s Note: We are estimating 900 monarchs based on observer&rsquo;s description of several locations on the island with a few hundred monarchs in each roost.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,900.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

They take kids from the inner city out into nature to show them what exists beyond their little world. They had been deer hunting in the morning and showed up in their camo ready to learn about monarchs. I told them all about the migration and the life cycle, then handed them all nets and they got to catch and tag. All the while, a film crew from the hunting tv show, Trophy Hunts, filmed them! How funny it is going to be to watch a deer hunting show and see Monarch Butterflies being hunted also!

This morning before sunrise I found hundreds of monarchs roosting in the bayberry bushes along the causeway. As soon as the sunlight hit their wings they started to bask (full sun, temp 48 degrees, humid).  Their wings were covered with dew and it took about 1.5 hours before they dried out enough to take flight. The wind was NNE between 2-4mph and temperature rose to 60 degrees; perfect for them to easily drift off this island, which some of them did for the next 2 hours. (Kiptopeke folks-- they may reach you by late afternoon. I tagged some before they left, so look for tagged ones). Many stayed behind to nectar on the seaside goldenrod that I had planted this past spring. All the nectaring monarchs that I examined close up had lean to very lean abdomens. I tagged some of those to see how long they stay to refuel. The monarch migration along the Virginia coast is not over yet. I expect more to drift in from the north end of Assateague during the day today.<P>Courtesy of Monarch Watch<P>Editor&rsquo;s Note: We are estimating 200 monarchs based on observer&rsquo;s estimate of &ldquo;hundreds.&rdquo;",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9710973,200.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Mexico.  <p>I enclose some pictures I took yesterday afternoon.  As you will see there were thousands of Monarchs, particularly in one tree.  The location of the natural park can be seen in the Google Maps here: http://goo.gl/maps/fkzW <p>As you can see if you click on the Earth button, there is a mountain ridge just south of the parking/picnic area of the park.  There are lots of oak species and other large trees to which the Monarchs seem to be drawn to roost.  During daytime, they travel fast above this ridge, pulling south, but at aprox. 5 pm, i.e. one hour before sunset, they seem to start communicating among themselves and chose spots to roost for the night.  All of the roosts are in parts of the trees where the sun shines until it sets.  We always wonder how they communicate, my personal theory calls for pheromones, as they flutter their wings rapidly after landing on the tree.  This seem to draw more and more butterflies to the same spot.  Fascinating.<p>We saw no Monarchs drinking nectar, as if they do not have time for that.  In the area there are lots of wild Salvia species in flower, I am not sure if they are good nectar sources.  Otherwise it is poor at this time of year.  We are deep into a cold front right now, last morning we had -4&deg;C (wind chill -8&deg;C) and this is the 3rd night in a row we have strong frost at night.

It was still blustery wind from the northwest and clouds came in to cover the sun.  Roosts dissipated gradually and some partially reformed because of the cold, wind, and clouds.Was not able to watch all day or to go back last night, but this morning I found two dozen, plus a few more. I suspect they were new Monarchs that stopped there after migrating yesterday, but I do not know this for sure.  Fifteen were in a huge elm tree bordering the north edge of the field, beyond where all the previous day's roosts had formed.There were a few scattered singles and doubles.By 8:00 a few Monarchs were feeding in the alfalfa, but it was too  cold for much activity.  Wind from the southeast today, and the farmer will be cutting this part of the alfalfa field.  <p><B>September 3</B><br>Saw many roosts about 8 miles southwest of Osceola along the edge of a ripe alfalfa field. Temperature today was in the high 70s, perhaps 80. Wind picked up from the northwest late morning and grew stronger as evening approached. Temps by 7:00 were dropping into the middle 60s with a low of 49 predicted by morning. The first Monarchs I saw were fighting the wind and looking for shelter along the edge of the woods that borders the north side of the field and along the road that borders the eastern edge. I started along the road, walking the eastern wood edge and seeing a few monarchs and small clusters; I ended up walking the field, going west. At first, most of the Monarchs were scattered and smaller clusters formed and broke up repeatedly. As the sun set and darkness came on, the roosts grew stronger. The roosts were the biggest I have ever seen. Several of the trees must have held hundreds of Monarchs. I was fighting darkness but did get a few photos and some good video of the numerous branches and trees that held roosts. Although I cannot give an exact count on the numbers of roosts and Monarchs, I would say there were 6-8 trees that each held major roosts of 200 or more Monarchs each, with additional smaller roosts. And so I would say there were at least 1,000 Monarchs roosting......and possibly many more....twice that? Very cold predicted for tomorrow, with temps just into the 60's. North wind also predicted, and sunny, so I believe the Monarchs will migrate again. <P><B>Sat, Aug 27</B><br> Northerly wind predicted for today.  Looking for Monarchs to be migrating. I plan to explore new areas for a peak nectar source.........Found two red clover fields with lots of Monarchs in the afternoon.  Got permission to photograph in one of them.  Temperature was too warm....high 70's.....and there were trees all around the field, so I wasn't lucky enough to get a huge roost.  But I did see lots of small groupings, ranging from 3-6......and of course, lots and lots of singles.  (additional note:  all monarchs from our back hill area were gone yesterday, except for two newly emerged monarchs)Winds predicted to be southerly for the next few days, so I suspect there will not be much migrating activity here until the next front moves through.....but individual fields should hold good Monarch viewing until then.<p><B>Friday, Aug 26</B><br>  mid 80's, wind varied, but mild.  Saw fewer Monarchs on the back hills.  I believe yesterday's early northerly breeze might have sent some off.  Spent the evening looking for a good nectar source....almost all the good fields of alfalfa are being cut just as they begin to bloom.  Very disheartening, from the Monarch's point of view.  Did find an old field of red clover/pasture that had 2+dozen Monarchs feeding.  I saw many roosting for the night in an open woodlot on the west edge of the pasture.  Temps were high 70s so the best ""cluster"" I found was 3.  <p><B>Thursday, Aug 25</B><br> there were probably two dozen monarchs actively feeding on goldenrod and thistle on the back hills.  On our 35 mile trip to River Falls, we saw half a dozen flying west (into a WNW wind).  Late afternoon, we saw a ripe alfalfa field with lots of Monarchs feeding.....don't know if they were local butterflies or migrating.  The field was being cut, unfortunately so I didn't return for the evening. <p><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647a.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647b.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647c.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647d.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647e.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647f.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647g.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647h.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_mn1315133647i.jpg""><p><p><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_wi_1314540557lg.jpg""><P>Monarch nectaring in field of red clover.<p><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/fall_clover_mn1314540557.jpg""><p><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/fall_clover_wi_1314540557lg.jpg""><p>",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9936645,1000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

It has been planted to prairie vegetation of various quality, composition, and diversity through the efforts of Randy Arndt, Preserve Manager, and his staff. Composition varies depending on the seed harvest the year before plantings were done, the weather conditions the year of planting (and subsequent years), amount of competition from invasive species, and soil type depending on past land use and topographic position.<p>Nectar species available during migration include saw-toothed sunflower (Helianthus grosseserratus), New England aster (Symphyotrichum (Aster) novae-angliae), and a small amount of rough blazing star (Liatris aspera). I'm by no means an expert on nectar sources. Other fall possibilities might include several other asters - Aster ericoides, Aster oolentangiensis, Aster drummondii, Aster pilosus (weedy in the plantings - we'd like to get rid of or at least reduce it), and Aster praeltus; goldenrods include showy goldenrod (Solidago speciosa) (uncommon to rare at the ranch), Missouri goldenrod (Solidagomissouriensis) (uncommon at the ranch), old field goldenrod (Solidago nemoralis), tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) (abundant and weedy - we'd like to greatly reduce it as it is practically taking over some plantings), stiff goldenrod (Solidago rigida), grass-leaved goldenrod (Euthamia (Solidago) gymnospermoides), grass-leaved goldenrod (Euthamia(Solidago) graminifolia); sweet coneflower (Rudbeckia subtomentosa); two or three other sunflowers, and likely others I'm forgetting.<p>Milkweeds providing summer nectar and larval food include butterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa) (common though pod production for seed is spotty and unpredictable), purple milkweed (Asclepias purpurascens) (uncommon to rare though we are trying to collect seed to add to the seed mix - like butterfly milkweed, pod production is unpredictable and usually light), swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) (common in swales on the unplowed prairie and some recovering swales on disturbed areas - pod production more consistent and predictable), Sullivant's or prairie milkweed (Asclepias sullivantii) (rare with pod production very limited in most years so far), common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) (common to abundant with pod production the most consistent of any of the milkweeds- doesn't usually compete to the point of ""smothering out"" other forbs so we don't currently manage against it), whorled milkweed (Asclepiasverticillata) (common on disturbed sites in some years), tall green milkweed (Asclepias hirtella) (uncommon to common depending on the site- fairly consistent seed producer).<p>Dunn Ranch is about 3,000 to 3,500 acres.

Largest numbers seen so far this season. 500 monarchs.  May also have found a new roost on MSU's campus in a massive oak tree.  Hundreds of butterflies roosting in this massive tree which was oozing with sap thru it's leaves.  Will keep an eye on this tree over the next couple years to see if its a roost or a feeding tree.  right now I'm calling it a roost because the hudnreds that were on there were spotted at 06:45 p.m., which is about the time they have been coming in to roost.  I was afraid this year the monarchs would be further east of us due to the severe drouhgt and lack of feeding plants, but I guess there is something out there they are fedding on, because these are just down right FAT and healthy monarchs which makes me feel good.

This is the beginning of the migration for us, and we spotted about 60+ monarchs and we caught 25 in less than an hour and tagged 20 of them and released.  We ran out of tags or else we would have caught many more.  Several were mating also.<p>The monarchs were coming in to roost around 0700 P.M. in the evening.  They roost here every year.  Its a grove of willows and it forms a tunnel over a shallow wet area that floods sometimes.  The main migration pack has not arrived...we figured this was just the leading edge of them.  They roost here in the hundreds every year.  We accidentally came upon this site a few years ago while tagging them.  I'll try to get pictures tonight.  One year I caught 46 monarchs in my net at one time...that is how many roost on one limb.  They are not that thick so far, but we are hoping. <p>The Texas Master Naturalist (wife and I are members for the past 6 years also) have been tagging monarchs for the past 6 years.  We have noticed a decline in the numbers thru our area.  The drought has taken its toll on this area as far as nector producing plants.  Good news though, if the monarchs can make it 70 miles south of us, there is ALOT of milkweed and other flowers, sunflowers, and some purple flowers that grow on a short stock (don't know what they are).  We have had recent rain over the past couple days and this has help the sunflowers start to bloom in our immediate area, so we hope they find a source of nectar in our area.  We did note that the monarchs we are catching seem to be very FAT, so they are getting it somewhere.  I suspect these may be coming from further east of us, which has had more rain than us, meaning more flowers in the east. <p>Here are a few pictures of the area they roost in.  The numbers were way down tonight, about 30 - 40.  We did manage to catch about 10 and tagged 10 in 30 minutes.  One of the pictures is the purple flower I mentioned they were feeding on in the open fields around Wichita Falls.  I suspect the main flow of monarchs this year will be more east of us simply because of the lack of nectar producing flowers, due to the drought.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roostarea_tx_1316491343_01.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roostarea_tx_1316491343_02.jpg"">",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9947142,500.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Where they were is a short walk (over the river and through the woods so to speak) from the international water lily garden of San Angelo and there several other types of flowers than lilies as sources of nectar over there. I am not certain if it was an overnight roost, since I am not very familiar with monarch habits, but now that I think it about it - probably! It was around 7pm when we found them and they were mostly resting on shrubs and bushes and didn't fly until a squirrel would jump through or if we brushed against the bush they were on. Even then they would fly right back to rest.

As a cool front approaches, we'll see if we get another influx!<p><B>October 11</B><br>the early morning was awe inspiring today - pastel color sky with light wispy clouds with monarchs slowing warming up to take to the air.  Some flew high in the sky, some circled out to the ocean and than made their way back to the goldenrod, while others just flew from flower to flower and along the dunes eventually finding their way into resident gardens.  The winds were coming from all directions today with the fronts moving in.  The monarchs held strong during the day feeding.  No roosts to speak of tonight.  We'll see what happens if we get rain tomorrow. <p><B>October 10</B><br>The monarchs came sailing into town today.  The goldenrod was covered and  anytime you looked in the air you'd see them at all levels; up high, in the dune and circling over head.  I stood on a dune cross over and had dragonflies and monarchs gliding past me for hours !!!  Many hawks in the air too.  It was a very magical day.  A friend of ours was up in Stone Harbor and said it was full up there til about 11 am - maybe we welcomed some of those in Cape May.Many monarchs were still nectaring at 5:30 pm and I'm thinking they were going to hang out on the goldenrod til morning.  We'll see tomorrow as daylight arrives!<p><B>October 9</B><br>The monarchs were making there way down the dunes feasting on the goldenrod today and some were seen in gardens, but it was at a slower pace than any of the last week.<p><B>October 8</B><br>Here is an update for Friday and today:<br>Quite a few monarchs crossed the Bay again this morning, Friday Oct. 7th.  The ones that hung around were found feeding like crazy in gardens around town.  We had a minor influx of monarchs today but no roosting for the night.<p>Saturday, Oct. 8th the monarchs were scattered here and there feeding in gardens which is always enjoyable but there was not a spectacular movement of any into Cape May today.  We're still hoping for one more wave of them this fall.<p><B>October 6</B><br>Today at about 8 am the monarchs on the roosts from last night started crossing the Delaware Bay.  There was a gentle wind of N 6 mph.  We counted 500 per minute at the start, than 430, and by the end of an hour it was 59 per minute.  The wind changed to NW and all day there were monarchs sailing into Cape May.  They were feeding til about 6:15 tonight.  We had a few small roosts of a few hundred but it was fairly warm and they seemed to want to nectar until dusk.  Some small butterfly bushes had 50 monarchs on them at once - it was quite the sight!!  The sea watch in Avalon said yesterday that they stopped counting after approximately 5,000 monarchs flew by!  The hawk flight was fabulous too with many kettles of mixed species but also 2 kettles of approximately 100 broad-wings.  We've also noticed that yellow-rumped warblers have arrived in large numbers!  And Still a good diversity of other warblers around the Cape May.<p><B>October 5</B><br>Cape May Point had many roosts tonight.  The biggest being in the 1,000's.  It was a spectacular sight with the last bit of sun shining through their silhouetted wings on the pine trees.  There were also some smaller roosts in different areas of the neighborhood.  It was a warm night and the monarchs were still nectaring well after 6 pm.  Today was an easy day to tag - the butterflies were so busy feeding that you could pick them off the bushes by hand.  I did notice that during the influx of butterflies yesterday most of them were males.  Today mostly females.  I also noted that the males fat measure was higher than the females - probably due to them just arriving while the males has all day to feed.  More tomorrow......<p><B>October 4 late</B><br>The monarchs did continue to fly down the dunes in Cape May Point today.  Many small roosts of 50, 100, and 300 butterflies were located in the neighborhoods of Cape May Point and in the dunes tonight.   There was also a nice size roost of approximately 1000 or more butterflies in Stone Harbor.  More reports to come.....<p><B>October 4 early</B><br>I've attached a photo of some of the roost from the other night.  There were no real roosts last night (10/3) but tonight could be fabulous.  LOTS of monarch flying down the dunes in Cape May today beginning early this morning til now, and continuing all day I'm sure. They're roosting and basking in bushes and trees in the sun, out of the wind, and nectaring on english ivy that's blooming.  They've also been nectaring on Seaside goldenrod in the dunes and zinnia's, lantana,  and butterfly bush, new england aster in resident gardens.  I will post all this on the sightings report after tonight to see if they are more roosts to report.  <p><B>October 1 </B><br>The monarchs started flying into Cape May Saturday day and began forming roosts around 4 pm.  The biggest roost found was approximately 3-400 monarchs.  Other roost areas had 50 - 100.  Sunday (10/2) was a chilly 50 degree day and they stayed on the roosts.  Today (10/3/11) they are starting to fly and feed again.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_capemay_1317660374.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/roost_capemay_1317660374_01.jpg"">",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9949828,1000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I spotted about 150 monarchs feeding on golden rod and other delicacies.  <p><B>October 8</B><br>I was out at Jones Beach and Robert Moses again this afternoon. I spotted over 250 monarchs in 4 hours, they are still coming!!! <p>The monarchs I spotted earlier today looked strong and once again were feeding on golden rod. It was gorgeous today 77 degrees and sunny with a mild/ moderate south west wind, Closer to sunset the wind picked up a little and the monarchs looked tired. The past several sightings the monarchs roosted together in large numbers and congregated in several trees. Tonight there were smaller roosts 4 -5 monarchs in many pine trees. I don't know if it is because the weather was warmer and will be about 10 degrees warmer throughout the night or the monarch migration is wrapping up.  <p>I read in the Monarch newsletter that the number of monarchs migrating are down this year, however I spotted more monarchs this year then I have since 2005. I don't know if I just happened to time it right, or due to Hurricane Irene that hit the east coast in late August  their migration patterns changed or they migrated in greater numbers in less days?   But is was a magical and surreal experience. <p><B>October 5</B><br>After two rainy days comes another magnificent afternoon of monarchs migrating and roosting. I spotted over 500 this afternoon in 2 hours. The wind was moderate from east north east, it was sunny and 65 degrees.

After feeding on golden rod flowers they settled in the pine trees on the dunes of the beach for the night. They looked very healthy with a couple of monarchs having been tagged. <p><B>October 2</B><br>Day 2. After a magical day of a large monarch population migrating through the south shore of Long Island, today the journey continues. Once again it is a beautiful 70 degree sunny day with a light south easterly breeze, there are more than 300 monarchs throughout the day. They all look healthy and enjoy feeding on golden rod. They continue to fly from east to west on their long migration. As it gets later in the day, the number of monarchs decreases, with the mid day having the strongest showing. <p><B>October 1</B><br>The monarchs return! On a beautiful 65 degree sunny Saturday afternoon with a light south-easterly wind the monarchs turned out. I spotted over 600 monarchs on their migration. The food sources are now abundant and popping. As I drove up the Ocean Parkway, the monarchs were flying from east to west. Around 5 pm they started to roost in the pine trees. The majority of the monarchs looked very healthy, a small percentage had a tear in their wing, but this didn't stop them.

They soared with very little flapping. On a site count at 9am, I counted 60 per hour. Since they didn't have to fight against the wind, they were stopping often to nectar on the seaside goldenrod. On Chincoteague Island, the town square garden's lantana bushes were full of nectaring monarchs. Then on the 4-hour drive home,  I saw monarchs migrating along and over highways with regularity. The eastern shore of the Chesapeake at Kent Island was especially busy with migrating and nectaring monarchs. <p><B>October 6 am</B><br>Recovered a tagged monarch! It was not one of mine. It was found and photographed today (Oct 6) at 6:58am in a roost of several hundred monarchs on seaside goldenrod at the water's edge of Tom's Cove. It would have flown into the roost sometime between 4-7pm last evening, Oct 5.  The number is PLY 162. If anyone reading this can claim it, please let me know where you tagged it and the date/time. Thanks!  And, if anyone is going to Kiptopeke for the the birding festival during the next few days, please keep a lookout for my tagged monarchs. The letters are PEP.<p> I photographed several monarch roosts on seaside goldenrod along the beach this morning. These were the biggest roosts on goldenrod that I have ever seen here. Sunrise was at 7:01am. The wind was NNE at 8mph, temp was 61 degrees with clear skies. The monarchs began leaving the roosts at 7:10am (there was no hesitation or lingering), and by 8am there was not a monarch to be found on south Assateague. At 9am there were a few monarchs left at the tip of Chincoteague Island, but they soared off over Chincoteague Bay as I watched. The wind is still NNE but it has picked up speed to 15mph-- excellent conditions for monarch migration, just not on this island. The folks on the Virginia eastern shore of the Chesapeake are likely seeing lots of monarchs just about now.<p> The weather forecast shows the next cold front for Chincoteague NWR on Friday, Oct 14, followed by NW wind and full sun on Saturday Oct 15. If that forecast holds, local monarch watchers may want to plan a trip to be here on that day. I may be back as well. <p><B>October 5 pm</B><br>A mid-day site census had 860 monarchs per hour, and these numbers were about the same most of the day. I have had higher numbers many times in past years, but today's migration was different because the flow of monarchs remained constant during all the daylight hours. Plus, the wind speed and direction remained the same-- NW at around 10-15mph.  <p>Monarchs were also spread out over all areas of both islands (about a 5-mile wide band of monarchs). At mid-day, there were migrating monarchs going south on Chincoteague's Main Street and on the bridge that connects Chincoteague Island to the Delmarva Peninsula. Monarchs were also stopping frequently to nectar on any available nectar source. After two days of sun, the seaside goldenrod is rapidly showing more blooms, and monarchs were taking advantage of this offering. On Assateague, the nectar of choice was from the flowers of groundsel-tree (Baccharis halimifolia). On Chincoteague, monarchs were dropping into residential flower gardens to sip from large lantana bushes and from the large globular bushes of a New England aster cultivar. These were loaded with hundreds of deep purple blooms, and just about each one had a nectaring monarch on it. I checked these plants at 6:30pm and monarchs had settled in them to roost for the night. This presents a problem. The town of Chincoteague's Mosquito Man drives all over the island in his pick-up truck spraying malathion every Tues, Thurs, and Saturday at 7am. So that means I will have to trespass on private property to be at the New England aster at 6am to pluck off all the roosting monarchs, put them in my cage and transport them over to Assateague.  <p>Just before sunset this evening, my volunteers and I walked to all the usual roost sites along Tom's Cove. We found at least a dozen roosts on seaside goldenrod, so heavy with monarchs that they were bent over almost to the ground. They were photographed and filmed by my photographer volunteer and will  be posted on my new facebook page in a week or so. The images clearly show why seaside goldenrod is undeniably the most important monarch plant at this location on the island.  <p>During the night tonight, the wind is supposed to shift and come out of the northeast. It will push thousands of monarchs safely off this island to the Delmarva, where they can nectar and have a respite from the ocean. But they will need to rebuild their fat reserves before they reach Kiptopeke, where they will have to cross the wide mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. I hope someone at Kiptopeke State Park recovers one of my tagged monarchs, because it would be interesting to find their arrival date and time. If they fly nonstop, they can be there within a day (it is 70 miles away), but if it takes several days, I would know that they stopped to refuel along the way.<p><B>October 5</B><br>I arrived at the beach at 6:30 am this morning  so that I could photograph the roosting monarchs before sunrise and just after when the light is a soft peachy color. The wind was NW at 5mph, clear skies, and temp 60 degrees. With such ideal migration conditions, I thought the monarchs would leave the roosts en mass soon after sunrise, but that was not the case. It had been humid during the night and their wings were still damp. So those monarchs that roosted along the beach in the seaside goldenrod stayed put. I was able to videotape one roost along the road that was in a bayberry bush fully exposed to the sun as the monarchs lifted off about 8am. About 100 or so lifted off together, followed by 6-7 at a time until they were all airborne. Such a beautiful ballet. <p>I just got a ""monarch alert"" call from one of the refuge staff. There is apparently a bush with thousands of monarchs still clinging so I will close for now and finish this report later. Off I go. Love days like this!<P><B>October 4 pm</B><br>The monarchs migrated down the beach today in a continuous stream from 8:15am to 6:15pm. The average was about 600 per hour. Once they arrived at the narrow section of the island (about 100 yards between ocean and bay), they stopped to nectar on seaside goldenrod or they turned around and headed back over to the causeway. One side of the causeway has a freshwater impoundment and the other has a saltmarsh. The causeway is elevated so monarchs stayed low in the bayberry thicket at the edge of the marsh, completely out of the wind. The grounsel-tree (bushes) in this spot were loaded with nectaring monarchs all day. This is where I could safely tag and release them, without risking having them blow backwards out over the ocean. However it wasn't so safe for me because if I stood too long in one place, I would sink down about a foot into the soft mud, making me an easy target for the saltmarsh mosquitoes (the things we do for Monarch Watch . . .) <p>The winds remained from the NW all day, usually from 10-15mph, but picking up speed to about 20mph for an hour or two. By 6:30 there were some sizeable roosts forming along the causeway near the NPS visitor center in the bayberry bushes that had survived Irene, and in the bare branches of those that did not. <B>I estimated about 5,000 monarchs in 7 separate roosts </B>(that I could see from the road), but there were likely more in the dense thickets on the small islands in the freshwater impoundments, since I saw monarchs flying into them at dusk. <p>This was one of those days that left lasting impressions, both in my memory and on my memory card. Monarchs, buckeyes, green darners, black saddlebags, Carolina saddlebags, wandering gliders, spot-winged gliders, Peregrine falcons, merlins, harriers, bald eagles, osprey, tree swallows, ruddy turnstones, black-bellied plovers, semi-palmated sandpipers, palm warblers, yellow-rumped warblers, cormorants, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, sanderlings, yellowlegs, oystercatchers, and pelicans all graced the island with their beauty and lifted the spirits of those few who opened their eyes to see it.<p><P><B>October 4 am</B><br>5:30-7am: heavy rain, then at 8am the skies cleared, the wind was NNW at 8mph with full sun, temp 56 degrees F.  I walked 1.5 miles south on the beach to some small dunes near the coast guard station that managed to keep some clusters of seaside goldenrod. I found several dozen roosting monarchs whose wings were still damp from the rain. But by 8:15 the island had come alive with migrating monarchs. The wind direction and speed was almost perfect for monarch migration on this island. Those that soared on the wind until they reached the ocean's edge were able to flap back to land without too much effort. Some were coming down to rest and nectar on the seaside goldenrod. I checked each one, and all had extremely lean abdomens. A steady wave of monarchs continued as I walked north back up the beach. I stopped to do a site count, and I counted 94 monarchs flying past me in 15 minutes, or nearly 400 monarchs per hour. <p>From 9:30-10:30 am the wind shifted and picked up speed-- NW at 15mph. This makes it a bit more difficult for migrating monarchs to avoid being blown out over the water, so many were doing this and then flapping nonstop to get back to the beach. Some came down to rest on bare wet sand. Many others were back-tracking north along the bayshore (Spartina grass being used as a wind buffer) then making their way back across the causeway to reach the buffer of the bayberry thickets. Heading back out now to try to net some to tag. More later.<p><B>October 3</B><br>12:30pm:  partly sunny, 61 degrees F, wind WNW at 8mph. The mid-day road census had 17 monarchs. All monarchs were migrating along the ocean beach at a height of about 5-10'. At 3:30 the sky darkened and monarchs started backtracking north along Tom's Cove to find roosting spots. Since all the shrubs and trees are gone, they roosted in the remaining seaside goldenrod and in the Spartina grasses of the saltmarsh. After the storm passed, the temperature dropped and the monarchs remained there to roost for the night. <p>If the large numbers of monarchs reported earlier today at Cape May crossed the Delaware Bay before day's end, they should be here by late day tomorrow. We will see. <P>Editor's Note: This report is dated October 3rd, the evening the estimated 5,000 monarchs would have formed the roosts viewed the morning of October 4th.

Here at Point Pelee we usually get a pulse of migrating monarchs in the first week of October with roosts of about 1,000 butterflies. The extra rain this year could easily account for this late pulse to arrive here two weeks later than normal.<p>The danger for monarchs migrating in late October is strong winds (as we've seen from last week's report on Journey North) and the first frosts of the fall season. We have had our first frost this past Saturday the 22nd October. So these monarchs are really living on the edge.

I met some other people that day who said there was also a large congregation of them about 1/4 mile further along the path in another sheltered area, but I did not find them.  <p>A friend told me they were also there (hundreds) on Saturday, September 15, 2012.  I went to the same area today, September 23rd at 5 PM, and saw perhaps 400 in the very same sheltered trees.  Temperature today was about 63 F, sunny, very clear air with low humidity, very light wind off the ocean. <p>I walked on Thursday, September 20th, and saw perhaps only 3.  It was early afternoon that day. <p>On Wednesday the 19th, a friend told me he had seen a large number in an area at York Beach, Maine, which is about 5 miles along the coast North of here. <p>I saw a large congregation of Monarchs at Fort Foster park several years ago, but I can't remember exactly when.  I mention this because I've heard they have been passing through here for many years, at least some years!<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/userfiles/1348100864a.jpg"">",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles/1348100864.jpg,9960835,1000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

There were large swarms at times, and it reminded us of the movie ""The Birds"". It was quite an impresive sight. I had heard about this happening in the past from my Aunt, We were amazed!! About five thirty or so, we were heading back and noticed that the Monarchs were settling down for the night on the trees. The trees were covered with groups from three to twenty at a time.

However, the field was many hundreds of acres in size so I was hopeful of finding dozens or even hundreds of monarchs roosting.Turned out to be an overly optimistic estimate, but it is possible that other areas surrounding the several huge blooming red clover fields might have held other clusters.

An hour or so before sunset I saw a few Monarchs already flying near trees that are typical roost sites.  But most Monarchs were still on flowers at sunset.  One-half hour after sunset none were obvious on flowers, but there was no obvious mass exodus either.  I did find some perched in larger Live Oak and Ashe Juniper trees, but not enough to account for all that were feeding.  I did not check every tree.  I found a couple roosting individually on tall forbs.  Wind had gone calm at sunset and remained so until sunrise when it rose quickly.  So they all ""roosted"" if I define roosting broadly, as anything that does not involve flying, eating or reproducing, ignoring whether they aggregated.<P>The image shows a small roost still under a large Live Oak at  8:30 the next morning (Oct. 8).

When I reached the grove, I saw Monarchs leaving as described above, and also within it flying and perching.  I had visited it an hour before and saw no monarchs.  So they must have been well concealed, widely distributed, and probably well up in trees.  That would make sense since the sun hits the tops first.  Many were perched on green foliage in sun 15-20 above ground.  Some that I disturbed from lower twigs in shadow flew up to perch in sunlight.  Monarchs were also drifting out of the grove steadily.<P>I have been asked to comment on plants. This grove is mostly large Ashe Juniper, plus Gum Bumilia, Live Oak, Sugarberry, Pecan, with Greenbriar, Grapevine and several other vines.  Understory shrubs Elbow Bush, Prickly Ash, American Beautyberry, Sumac, others, plus forbs and grasses.<P>While returning to house across the same meadow, I saw more monarchs than on the way out, flying and perched feeding.

That count was in a 20 minute time period.<P>""Resting in the trees"" for me is a roost because the exact same branches are used night after night and year to year. When the number of monarchs is large and up wind, the speed with which the still flying monarchs do a 180 degree turn, fly back up their path until they cross the scent stream of the already clustering/roosting body of monarchs, then zip straight over and alight, with all the nearby 'roosters?' ( or would that be 'roostees?') flashing their wings, is remarkable. For me cluster and roost are interchangeable. So does a roost imply only sleeping or resting over night?<P>I think our definition of ""Roost"" must vary somewhat. A matter of semantics. There is more a component of time, action, and stasis in your interpretation. My idea of ""Roost"" is a locus used year after year because of prevailing wind patterns &amp;/or any time there's a number of resting monarchs in a confined area for any length of time (a noun). This is a hangover definition from childhood for me of ""Chickens coming home to (the) roost.

Temperatures were in the 60s and are predicted to bottom out at 52 by morning.  Conditions were brisk wind from the west until dusk, clear skies, falling humidity.  <P>This afternoon, I found a good sized alfalfa field in full bloom. From one spot, viewing just a small portion of the field, I counted more than a dozen Monarchs so I knew there could be many dozens or even more than a hundred in the whole field.  The owner had cut half of the alfalfa today (and plans to cut the rest tomorrow).  Luckily, last week's wet weather had postponed his cutting.<P>I was fairly confident that the Monarchs would go to a small hill of trees near the center of the field; not so.  I gave up watching that spot at about 6:45 and drove out to the road, then north.  I saw two Monarchs flying north along the ditch, so I slowly followed them, figuring they would lead me to the preferred roosting spots, which they did.<P>That spot was an assortment of trees on a high point near the northwest edge of the field.  The owner gave me permission to photograph on his property and for an hour and a half, I watched a hundred or so Monarchs trying to settle in for the night at various spots around his acre or two woodlot and yard.  Most of them probably ended up as singles or small, loose clusters.  The clusters I ended up photographing were located on an oak tree along the wind belt and in a tall ash all by itself in the open yard.  <P>I would not have found the roosts if I had not followed the Monarchs; live and learn.<P>The owner watched with binoculars and helped me count and verify that we had at least three branches with ten or more Monarchs.  At one point I counted 20 as I panned the video camera.<P>Northerly winds are predicted for tomorrow (8/26/14) and the farmer is cutting the rest of the alfalfa; I suspect all of these Monarchs will be migrating as far south as the wind will take them.I thank them kindly for the show.  What a joy to see so many brand new, bright Monarchs.  They are a thing of great wonder and joy.........<P>Update August 26Monarch numbers have been far better this summer.  I haven't seen as many Monarchs for a long time.  Lately, I've become worried by the lack of caterpillars in my immediate areas, but yesterday's alfalfa field numbers and last night's roosts are very encouraging.<P>The weather has been wet for the last week with very few if any days with good north winds. We've had a mixture of cold days and then hot and muggy days.  Temperatures ranging from 60s to high 80s, depending on the day and specific area.<P>Yesterday (8/25/14) the humid weather was pushed out when a high pressure moved in, bringing drier air and strong westerly winds.<P>I was actually surprised to find so many Monarchs yesterday afternoon.  I cannot say whether they were mostly ""locals"" or not.<P>I do know that wind and weather has not been conducive to migration, but that has changed.  Today's northwest winds will almost certainly move Monarchs all over the area.  I will be checking for feeding Monarchs later this afternoon, but I suspect any that I find will not be those I saw feeding and roosting last night.<P>The three photos were taken this morning (8/26/14).  Near 50 degree temps and cloudy skies kept the Monarchs roosting long after daybreak, and a widespread cloud cover discouraged any early activity.<P>But the sun is shining now, and the temperature is 62.  After feeding, the Monarchs will be migrating.  No doubt in my mind.<p><img src=""/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/1409020697_01.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Monarch Butterfly Roost Fall Migration"" /></p><p><img src=""/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/1409020697_02.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Monarch Butterfly Roost Fall Migration"" /></p>",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9936645,100.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I spotted only two single monarchs after they landed.  Just before dark, I walked out to the north along the trail and spotted another flying monarch near the top of an elm tree.  I used binoculars to verify that it had indeed landed near other monarchs.  Luckily two or three other monarchs were still coming in from feeding, and one of those found the roost, bringing about the characteristic welcoming flutter that monarchs exhibit.  I was shooting video at the time but thought I could count about eight monarchs for sure.  The still photo I took a minute later shows at least eight and possibly ten or even twelve monarchs roosting, so I am going to claim credit for my second roost of the year, one week after the sighting last Monday.Even more importantly, this particular section has had a very nice population of emerging and feeding monarchs the last few days.  I believe many dozens or even hundreds of monarchs will owe their lives to this piece of land.....and in large part to the people who created new milkweed growth patches by cutting down thistles (and milkweed) on July 19.It is a wonderful piece of land and a wonderful piece of land management............I have photos, of course, but tonight I'll just show my roost : )",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/1409620241.jpg,9936645,10.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I got to one of the main roost sites just as the Monarchs were starting to warm up in the sun. I can only estimate the number of 500 or more on several smaller Eastern cottonwood trees. The cottonwood tree grove is in the middle of a Tallgrass prairie remnant on our farm. This has always been a good staging area over the years because of the food source (wildflowers) and native grasses.After the Monarchs warmed in the sun they began to move into the prairie remnant to forage on goldenrod, sunflowers and blazing star. I was surrounded by Monarchs just going about the business of fueling up for the flight south.I would estimate the number of Monarchs on our farm this weekend at well over 1,000. I know of 3 roost sites that had close to that many and I saw many individual Monarchs on our grasslands from 8-29 to 9-1-2014, they were not all in the roosts.Milkweeds are vital but so are undisturbed grasslands with a season long food source. We have about 200 acres of Tallgrass prairie on our farm, some native some restored. There are tree groves throughout for protection on the windy days, this weekend the Monarchs waited out the south winds in the trees and foraged on the native species.From my standpoint in western Minnesota it looks to rival 2011To see more of our Monarch habitat go to www.bigbluestemprairie.com",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/1409697118.jpg,9976849,500.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

The first time I saw them roost was Monday Sept 1. For about 1 week prior to that, I saw many monarchs flying around in our yard. I didn't know anything about ""roosting"" and their migration until seeing them and finding your wonderful website.Here's a summary: Monday September 1:- first roost sighting - between 6:30 and 8 p.m. - 1 cluster on edge of grove = 80Tuesday September 2:- lots of activity inside the grove of trees. That's when I noticed they were forming more than one cluster. They had increased to = 125-150. Mostly at edge of grove, maybe some inside.Wednesday September 3:- multiple clusters at edge of grove - increased to about = 200.Thursday September 4:- the most I have seen - 5 clusters at edge of grove - about = 300+. (If I could visually see 300 there were probably more). It was very warm, humid and windy with wind coming from the south. Was warm all 4 nights.Friday September 5:- Sadly no roost sightings. I did see them in the alfalfa field, and saw at least 10 flying near the tops of the trees in the grove but heading to the other side of the grove. I could not find any roosts. It was cold, and wind now coming from the north.Saturday, September 6--  They're back! It was warm and the wind was from the south. They were roosting in two separate groves this time. - 500 roostingSunday, September 7 - They were forming roosts in two groves again.- I'm estimating at least 400.We are blessed to be a hotspot for monarchs right now. An 18 acre field of fully blooming alfalfa and prairie grasses backs up to our property. The monarchs feed there by day.  Hundreds of them right now. It is difficult to estimate how many are in the field right now (9/7/14), I'm guessing more than 400 - but that's what I could reasonably report. They roost in our tree groves at night. A dozen are free flying around our property at any given moment. It was a labor of love to go out into the field this morning to observe them. The flowers are taller than my knee high boots, and the honey bees and bumble bees love the field too. Didn't need one of those down my boot.Here is a brief background of our property: we live on 3 acres. I have a large organic vegetable garden, and several blooming perennial gardens. We try to use mostly natural and organic yard products. Our backyard faces south and backs up to an 18 acre field of mostly alfalfa. It is cut and baled twice per summer/fall by a local farmer who leases it. Right now it is in full bloom with purple alfalfa flowers. The butterflies can be seen there during the day. The west side of our backyard has a perfect little grove of trees - mostly volunteer elm and ash. After reading your site, sounds like a perfect place for them to roost.

See <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/candy__kasey/sets/72157647561394606/"">story and photos here.</a> <p>It was cold Saturday.  On the lighthouse grounds, the car thermometer read upper 50s during most of the afternoon/evening.  The night the roosts formed (9/13/14), it was miserably cold all day, steady winds of 5-10 mph, and earlier in the day they were 20-30 mph.  The windchill had to be much lower than mid-50s when we first arrived to the island at around 11:30 am.   We very quickly drove by the sunflower field, little activity, just a few monarchs nectaring in the sunflowers that we could see from the car. We did not check the private drive at that time.  We had lunch and then went to Jackie's, etc.  When we returned to the lighthouse grounds around 3pm, the roosts were visibly beginning to form.  It was upper 50s.It wasn't hard to spot the roosts.  I just watched nectaring monarchs exit the sunflower field, and followed them as they flew toward the trees along the private drive.  Lone monarchs would fly up to the trees, then fly horizontally along the treeline until they spotted other monarchs.  The lone monarch would then attempt to settle in--sometimes the receiving cluster did not move; other times cluster members ""flashed"" the new arrival, but stayed put; other times the cluster broke up, everybody scattered/flew about 5-10 ft, then they all circled back and regrouped together back on the tree branches.Kasey was on the lighthouse grounds, where it was still windy.  You can see the tree branches moving in his video, whereas the other video was made on the private drive where it was much calmer.  I did video all the roosts along the whole length of the drive, but did not post the video--it is long, I couldn't zoom in well with Kasey's cameraphone, and I am hesitant to reveal too much to the public.I had a hard time photographing them at first.  The crunching noise my feet made on the gravel path was scaring them, and monarchs in the lower bushes kept taking to the air as I got within 10-15 ft of them, then they quickly resettled in the same area.  It took about a half hour for them to get comfortable with my presence.  Along the private drive, there was no breeze (leeward side of tree line), it felt slightly warmer, and was quiet.  Birds were beginning to roost too.  Most of the monarch roosts formed between 3-4 pm, some monarchs did move higher in the canopy until about 6:30 pm, trying to catch remaining rays of sunlight that still hit the tops of the trees.  They were in apple trees, honeysuckle bushes, and really any protected tree/bush along that treeline.  But most settled in about 15--30 feet off the ground, in common hackberry with red maple around http://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/trees/plants/hackberry.html. They were settled in by 7pm, it was 52F on the car thermometer at that time, parked at the lighthouse grounds.The next morning it was quite cool.  They did not leave the roosts in significant numbers until the temp reached 57F.  Then many nectared in the sunflower field and along the cliffs next to the water.  When we returned later in the evening, most all were gone.  Just a few tiny roosts left.",Monarch joint venture,-999999.999,-999999.999,9942133,400.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I will try to keep track of how many I see over the next month, each day.",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/09/1411264404.jpg,9977949,250.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0
69695,1411340612,2014-09-21,Monarch Fall Roost,50,44.266,-73.222,0,"I'm thrilled to report a roost of 50+ monarchs. I watched them gather tonight on the edge of my neighbor's 10 acre clover field that's in full bloom. I'm sure there were 100+ nectaring today throughout the field, but they didn't all roost in the same place. I found singles and doubles along the tree line. The roosting process was fascinating to watch: A butterfly would scout up and down the 100 yard tree line, back-and-forth. If it came close enough (within ~ 5 feet) to the group I was watching, the resting butterflies would flash their wings in unison-- and the monarch would circle around in join in (--or not). The butterflies were clustering loosely at the tips of a low branch of a tall ash tree, about 15 feet above the ground. The tree is probably ~80 feet tall. The branch they selected extends out from the tree line more than any other. (See branch at left in picture.) The roost was on the north side of the tree; a strong south wind was blowing all day, but had calmed by 6:00 when I was watching. At 10:30 pm I heard the wind howling and rain pelting against the windows.  Would they move to the south side of the trees? Would they fall to the ground? I went back this morning (9/22/14) at 7 am. Temperatures had fallen to 49F, the wind had shifted to the west and was blowing 15 mph. To my amazement, the monarchs were still gripping onto the leaves of the ash. The wind was tossing the branch to and fro and the monarchs held on for the ride, swaying at least 5 feet back and forth.  I did find one monarch on the ground. It was shivering to reach flight threshold and clumsily tried to fly when I approached.<P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/enh/vt_roost092114_01.jpg""><P><IMG SRC=""/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/enh/vt_roost092114_02.jpg"">",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9937188,50.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

With the bright light from overhead, it was easy to walk right up to them and not notice until they stirred.  <p>Total in all &ldquo;roosts&rdquo; about 200.

These plants are not usually found in residential landscapes - mostly in abandoned lots, fields, and along forest edges.

This is the same area where we had the large fall roost last year (8-31-14). I would estimate the number at 200, all looking very fresh. Did not expect to see a group of Monarchs this early in the season.<p>The photo was taken around noon or shortly after on 8-15. I went out on 8-16 and found a similar number of Monarchs in the same area but they had moved a bit to avoid the wind that had switched to the northwest overnight. They where in smaller roosts, the largest was about 60 in number and easily 200 total for the site. I have to assume the Monarchs were there on 8-14 as well but I did not check for them. It was hot, 97F with wind out of the south when I got to our farm on 8-14 at about 3 pm. The wind was strong from the south and it was hot on Saturday (8-15) so the Monarchs were down low shaded in the grass and a Smooth wild rose thicket. This should give you some idea of the temperatures for the time period.http://w1.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KFAR.htmlWe have about 200 acres of Tallgrass prairie on our farm, some native and some restored. The site where the Monarchs were located is a prairie remnant of about 10 acres with two areas of medium maturity ( 60 foot) Cottonwood trees surrounded by native grass and forbs. This has been a staging area over the years as the Monarchs can always escape the wind whatever the direction. The vegetation is very lush this year on this site coupled with the shade from the trees offers a good place to stay cool in the heat. We do not raise Monarchs but make our best effort to provide habitat for them. On the 160 acres of restored prairie I own and manage no chemicals are used and we time maintenance burns prior to the arrival of the Monarchs. Our grassland is part of a larger contiguous grassland complex (privately owned) that borders Campbell beach of glacial Lake Agassiz. Most of this grassland is undisturbed and provides ideal summer habitat for the Monarchs.

Four smaller roosts in the Tip parking lot center area one approx 500 there were two  along the road  to the large island what backs up to the parking lot areas just past the drop off  75-100 Monarchs each.  One in between the restrooms and the first path  that connects the east side to the west side paths about 50-75 in that one. Further down  that path another smaller one of about 25-35 monarchs in that roost There was an larger roost of 1000-1200. (Near the same spot as the smaller roost last night). It was down further into the interior and the east side of the trees in the same general area.  Harder to spot if some Monarchs had not been going to the area.   The largest roost was in the interior area near where last nights large roost was. Tonight's roost appeared larger than last nights large one  with  about 3800-4200 Monarchs in it.  Covering the east side of a couple of smaller trees in the center area where there was little to no wind.  The photo was of the bottom of the tree of the large roost  were in.

84177,1442203114,2015-09-13,Monarch Fall Roost,400,41.653,-82.818,0,"I spent the weekend on South Bass island in Lake Erie.I joined my good friends, naturalists Jackie Taylor and Sandi Glauser, at the Lake Erie Islands Nature and Wildlife Center, where we hosted our annual Open House event on Saturday morning.  Our busiest year yet&mdash;I&rsquo;m pooped.  Over 1000 scouts in 3 hours&hellip;  The day started very early Saturday am.  I arrived to South Bass island via the Miller Ferry at 7am.  I immediately went to the lighthouse grounds to look for roosting monarchs.  I only found six monarchs.  I then went to the nature center, where friends and I did an open house event from 9am to noon.  I then left my monarch displays at the nature center, and headed to the lighthouse grounds to join Nikki King, Leah and Ed from OSU for a monarch tagging program.  Nikki, Leah and Ed helped visitors tag, while I worked in the garden and answered visitors' questions about the garden.  I found 7 monarch larvae in the garden, ranging from 3rd to 5th instar--mostly 4ths. It was sunny, low 60s, slight wind from the north. I then returned to the nature center and packed up my stuff just before closing.  As I packed, I noted a cold and strong W/NW wind had moved in.   The winds escalated considerably over the next few hours, forcing organizers to cancel the memorial flare event that evening.  Waves crashed over the breakwall downtown, as over 1000 scouts huddled in tents on the grounds of Perry's monument.  Temps were in the low 50s.  I hoped the cold wind might bring in monarchs to roost for the night...  see photos here https://www.flickr.com/photos/candy__kasey/albums/72157658600564135After a cold, blustery night of howling WNW winds, I returned to the lighthouse grounds Sunday am to see if monarchs had dropped from the sky to roost overnight.  I arrived before the sun was up, and watched as the east sky purpled with the morning light. It was 52F, winds WNW at 5-10 mph.  At 6:45 am, I walked up to the hackberry trees, scanning the treeline for monarchs.  I found 300, resting in clusters of 1-2 dozen, scattered throughout the treeline about 15-20 feet up.  I used my flash to photograph them initially, and found a tagged monarch with code UNW 487.  As the sun continued to rise, the clusters began to softly light up.  I noted 100 more monarchs in the daylight, which I had not seen in the early dawn light.  By 7:45 am, the sun was shining directly on some of the trees, and monarchs began to bask.  When the sun's rays hit them enough to warm them sufficiently, they would burst from the trees in groups of around a dozen, flying just 10-20 feet from the trees before immediately circling back and landing on the trees--landing so they were further apart, and basking.  More and more began to bask.  The early morning light now created glare, and I was thankful I had come so early to photograph them when the lighting was softer.  A total of 400 monarchs!  See photos here https://www.flickr.com/photos/candy__kasey/albums/72157658183044290On my way home, I drove route 2 along the southern shore of Lake Erie. I stopped at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge to make a phone call to my mom, to check on my kids.  What a blessing it was that I did so!  I found ONWR had recently redesigned and installed 3 new butterfly gardens, loaded with A.s., A.i., and A.t.  All certified as monarch waystations.  The entryway garden had six 5th instars in the Ai., and I watched 4 viceroy nectaring on the rattlesnake master.

A gentleman came along while we were watching the roost grow and showed me pictures he'd just taken of another roost further north which may have been on last night's hackberry tree.

Did put out some sugar water for them (researched recipe and technique) but have not observed any activity at the three feeding stations I put out.  Still chilly here this morning, though. And very windy.<p>Probably the last 6 or 7 days I noticed monarchs flitting around through my east window, through which a small portion of the tree they favored was visible.  Noticed them because there seemed to be more than normal...it is normal to see one or two, but there always seemed to be half a dozen or more cavorting out there.  I only noticed that there were lots of them in my tree two nights ago (10/06), when I was leaving to go to town, and noticed my dog had drug a piece of firewood over there (he's a handful).  I was in awe.  Could not stick around long, as I had an appointment, but I did grab the camera and took a few pictures.  There were probably 10 or 12 branches covered in butterflies that night (10/06), so I would roughly guess a couple thousand.  The next morning (10/07), there were not as many, maybe 6 branches full.  Went out and took more photos, they stuck around most of the day yesterday (10/07), perhaps because we had a brisk wind out of the south.  Took my last photos yesterday (10/07) afternoon.  This morning (10/08) when I went out, there was only a few branches full, and this afternoon, I only saw one lone butterfly out there.<p> I don't know all the last week's overnight temps, but I do know it got down to 44 this past weekend.  It was a built damp out also, and we have had several mornings of waking up to fog this past week.  Same with wind direction...has been quite windy (normal for here).

In a cluster of a single netting of 76 butterflies we could find a swallowtail and a queen, but not every time.I do wonder if Queens are moving with the Monarchs and being counted. I suspect so, but not in sufficient numbers to skew any data. This was not a BIG fall for Queens. I had a few in August, but they were light in number. There were far more Queens in the early Spring than later.In contrast, back in 2010 (I believe) we had large numbers of Monarchs moving straight south from Abilene, Tx, Between Abilene and San Angelo 90 mi.

She reported 500.  I sent that message to a friend who is the wildlife management person at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. in charge of non-game animals and he is very interested in tagging monarchs in 2016. He showed up at my workplace on Monday, October 19, to tell me that he had seen more than 1500 Monarchs in Kokernot Park. He believes they had moved to Alpine from Fort Stockton. He was the one who informed me about the wind direction. We checked through WeatherUnderground and saw that the winds were coming from the S SW. I went the next day(yesterday, Tuesday, October 20) to Kokernot Park and saw monarchs in the trees. They weren't particular about which trees they were roosting in-pine, sycamore, ash. Several were high aloft, and had already taken flight south. Some were within touching distance, and it began to rain. They took shelter in the pine tree which was nearby.Currently (10/21), winds are from the S-SW. The weather forecast is for the the temps to drop to 50 degrees as a low on Friday, with winds from the N to NW. On Saturday, winds will be from the N. On Sunday, winds will be from the N, NNE.

We think the milkweed is thick enough and stonrg enough to come back in the deep big bend region bordering on mexico.  We have a great crop of milkweed on our property in Fort Davis at the Chihuahuan Desert Research Institute.

A notable observation came on the evening of September 28, 2015, when we witnessed hundreds, and likely well over 1,000 monarch butterflies three blocks east of the University of Nebraska at Kearney in the yard of a private residence. The pulse of activity occurred between approximately 5 pm and 6 pm, with butterflies in flight and also resting throughout the branches of an old-growth oak tree. People gathered to observe and commented that they had never seen such a large concentration of monarchs. Conditions seemed well suited for migration that day; we also observed a large flock of gulls migrating that evening. By dusk, the butterflies were no longer visible. <br>Submitted by Mary Harner and Keith Geluso, Residents of Kearney, NE",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9989050,1000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Wind direction was primarily from S, 15-20kt, and monarchs were on the N (leeward) side of the trees.We do bird surveys at this site.  We noted large numbers of monarchs flying here on 10/21/2015, but there were more on the report date (10/28) and we didn&rsquo;t see anything we&rsquo;d call a roost before 10/28.  I believe this has been a monarch site for a number of years, as we commented on it in field notes in 2010 and 2014.  Our surveys end at the end of October, so I wouldn&rsquo;t normally have a chance to say how long the roost lasts.  If it&rsquo;s important, we can probably get permission to check a couple of times (it&rsquo;s a restricted access site).In general, we see a lot of monarchs on the beaches of Jackson County Mississippi, especially along marshes and dunes that have been allowed to vegetate with flowering plants.  This has been true as long as I&rsquo;ve lived here (since 2005).  They probably took a big hit after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 because there were no flowers on the coast that year, but nobody was counting.

Moments later arrived at The TIP at 7:40 am &amp; for an hour observed 20-24 monarchs individually every minute or two come from the north on the calm east side of the Point and without hesitation (except for 1) flitted south out over Lake Erie &amp; out of view.

I first noticed about monarchs (M) flitting about while I was working on the house, about15-20 minutes before sundown on Aug 31.  I followed to where there were a dozen or so flitting about.  That is when I noticed the cluster on the tree of about 21 or so.  There were many more still flying around then. That was yesterday 8-31-2016.  If they roosted before I did not notice.  I was surprised that they picked such a small black walnut tree.  There are several other much larger BW trees nearby.  Usually they seem to like my big spruce trees.  (80-100ft planted in 1914) I walked around the shelterbelt and saw many more still flying around.  I found another cluster higher up in a green ash deeper in the shelterbelt. But by that time I could not see how many had landed on that tree because there was not enough light.  I just know there was real close because of the concentration of M in that close area.        As for nectar,  My pastures are covered by red clover this year.  I always have a bunch, but this year is extraordinary.  I could cut it for hay, but I don&rsquo;t need it.  There are also numerous wild flowers around.  I have noticed quite a few had been hanging out by my grapes and flying back and forth from them to the mulberry tree.  I wonder if they were getting any sugars from the damaged grapes the birds left me?        This morning (9/1) the temperature was 56 F.  Yesterday hit 84, by this time it was still in the high 70&rsquo;s.  Really light SE breeze 2-3 mph, less than 5mph I&rsquo;m certain.  The M were shielded from the breeze as this was a special condition.  Really light breeze, taller grass, and the trees haven&rsquo;t started to drop their leaves yet.  In a normal year the black walnuts would have already dropped their leaves.  The wind can get in where the M were. But the breeze was too weak. That is why I usually see the roosts on the big spruces.  The BW they were in is only 8-10 ft high.  The M were only 6 ft off the ground. The photo I have was taken about 10 minutes before sundown.  At that time there were just as many, if not more, still flying around than were roosted.  This photo looks to the SE.",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2016/09/1464672914.jpg,9994021,30.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

All this past week I have noticed considerable numbers of monarchs, more than I have seen all year, suggesting the migration was at its peak here in southern Nebraska. One of our prairies in particular, which is largely dominated by late blooming forbs (sunflowers and the like), was full of monarchs fueling up for their migration. I guessed, correctly, that they would roost in the treeline immediately south of the prairie. On September 9, 2016, I counted a minimum of 400 individuals in a small section of that treeline- there may have been closer to 500, but I prefer to underestimate. The attached photo is of the largest cluster, which contained approximately 100 individuals. I also have photos of many smaller clumps ranging from 25 - 75 individuals on other trees. All seemed to be in excellent condition - they all looked very fresh, good coloring, no torn wings or battered individuals that I could see. The following day I saw far fewer on the wing, and could find none roosting at dusk, so I'm assuming they moved on.

They refused to settle and kept fluttering and disturbing each other. At sunset as we were leaving (20:00) spotted 2 separate individuals roosting in 2 separate trees on either side of the tip path. One was a female and the other's wing was hidden behind a leaf. An anthropomorphic observation would be that these fellows with their gregarious behaviour were casual about their journey and not as serious and driven as the ones we have witnessed later in the autumn with colder temperatures and shorter daylight in previous years.

Wind direction N to WNW. Visibility about 10 miles.  Overnight in low 50's. The day before, 09 Sept, we had a huge rain storm with wind gusts up to 30 mph.  Conditions on 11 Sept:  Temperature in mid 70's.  Wind 10-15 mph with gusts to 25 mph. Wind direction South.  Visibility about 10 miles. Overnight temps in mid 50's. The location is in a treeline with restored prairie on one side and corn/soybean cropland on the other. The prairie side supports all their favourite nectar sources.  They moved around the trees to protect from wind.  Many branches averaged 15-20 or more of resting monarchs.  Over several trees at least 150+ not counting all the ones you couldn't see because they looked like dead leaves. On these same two days I also saw smaller swarms of monarchs on my farmstead about 4 miles west of Glacier Creek Preserve.  At the farm the monarchs were roosting in a treeline that has corn/beans on one side and clover pasture on the other side.  I had about 50 in this area.

After parking we walked back along the road to find a group of 10 or 12 trying to roost in a Hackberry tree on the East side of the tip road in strong winds. We left them and headed further South passing another 12 heading North presumably they joined the first group. Watched many more join a roost already forming in one of the historical roost trees (Hackberry). This one numbered at least 100 at this point. A fellow Monarch enthusiast pointed out a small roost of 6 which had already formed even further South directly over the main tip trail almost at the tip. The sun had now set.  While trying to decide where to look next my son almost collided with a Monarch headed North up the trail from the direction of Lake Erie. So we headed out on the sand and witnessed Monarchs flying off the lake from the Southeast and Southwest seemingly appearing out of nowhere flapping furiously to avoid being carried back out over the lake. We followed them to the large roost which kept growing in the fading light. We suspect there may be many more in isolated roosts wherever they could find refuge for the night.  My concern is for the ones who may have not made landfall. People in Ohio on the southshore of Lake Erie should be on the lookout tomorrow. Anyone in Point Pelee in the morning will likely be treated to a beautiful sight. What a night! ,-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9968455,150.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

It was 5pm.The location is rural north-western Illinois.  Our road is a country/gravel road with relatively few houses and a lot of farm/pasture land surrounding it.  The monarchs themselves situated in a field between our 6 acre parcel (mostly unmowed and left to grow wild) and a farmer&rsquo;s large alfalfa field. They were situated in a line of trees on the fence row bordering the farmer&rsquo;s field.  The land around is a sort of manicured prairie area with a path mowed around the perimeter for walking.  The man who owns it burns it off early each spring, and what grows back is a mixture of very tall and lovely grasses, clovers, and some wildflowers. The farmer&rsquo;s field adjacent to it appears to have been planted with alfalfa this year, and parts of it are being used as grazing area for cattle.    The temperature dipped into the mid 50&rsquo;s.  It was a very still night.  There wasn&rsquo;t even enough wind to make the tall prairie grasses sway.  If there had been any wind, the monarchs would not have been shielded from the wind positioned as they were.  The trees are on a crest of a hill in an area of hills and valleys.   I can say that 100% of the monarchs were on the sides of the trees that faced south and west.  I was told by my neighbor (the one who owns that property) that the monarchs come every year to their field and that they stay about a week.  She can&rsquo;t recall a time when they&rsquo;ve been as numerous as they were Wednesday evening.  She said last year there were only a few that she saw.

The edge of the alfalfa is approx. 100 feet from the willows. There is also wild golden rod in the immediate area.  We also have patches of clover in bloom. It is an uncultivated clover. Big red clover to be exact.  According to wunderground weather,  the nighttime lows got to the middle to high 50's I will guess the temperatures at roosting time were in the middle 70 range. A short sleeve shirt was quite comfortable. The wind direction was from a slight south westerly,  but closer to the ""calm"" range. The monarchs were in a shielded area. At approximately 1140 feet, but on the north slope of a hill, in a low spot. But not the lowest spot in the area.

Friday had more cloud cover though.  We arrived late; right at sunset.  There were high North winds on both sides of the tip and we could not imagine Monarchs finding much shelter.  Saw a Monarch flying North over the car again on the parking lot road but were unable to locate it or its resting place.  Met up with a friend who showed us to 2 roosts. In an historical roost tree there were approximately 95 individuals clustered on a South facing branch.  In an adjacent denuded dead sapling immediately to the East there was a small group of 10.  We suspect there were more roosts as anecdotal reports stated the monarchs were flying everywhere in the high winds just prior to sunset. The tree cover is thick and the trails are limited so observers are not always able to follow the Monarchs' flight. Another friend in our group said one of his friends had located a roost in a Walnut tree in the West beach parking lot further North in the park.  People were telling me they had seen Monarchs all over Essex and Kent counties throughout the day.  There was a report of a steady stream sighted flying straight off the tip through the day with the North wind at their backs.  I only wish the person had counted the rate per minute... Perhaps someone in Ohio will spot them and report here.,-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9968455,105.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

It was tricky counting them as there were many clusters interspersed among the branches. This is, sadly, the biggest roost we have seen at Pelee this year. My son and I still hold out hope for more  as we know of 6 chrysalids yet to emerge so there must be more Monarchs still to fly in Southwestern Ontario.

I did not hold out much hope for a roost with the wind direction and as it was the only day in well over a month that we did not see a Monarch in Essex County.  (We have  been averaging 5 per day.)  We watched at least 6 individuals struggling against the wind, try to roost in single exposed trees on the west side ranging from Juniper, to Cottonwood to Hackberry.  None were successful in the high wind.  Observed one individual flapping northward but being carried South.   Others were picked up and carried over the treetops to the East Beach.   Met a friend leaving to resume her family Thanksgiving dinner who directed us to look in this season's roost tree.  Along our way we spoke with another visitor who indicated she had seen about 30 trying to roost on the East Beach.  With daylight waning we went directly to the Hackberry tree where we watched as more Monarchs joined a group already settled in on the leeward side at the very top.  Observed three clusters and some singles.  I did not realize how tightly they were clustered until I started counting.  In virtually the same area of tree as our 175 roost from 10/02 I counted 257!

At the west end of the island there were hundreds of monarchs roosting and sunning on the dunes and in the brush! Hurricane may have put them off course!! They are in beautiful condition!I saw them coming from the ocean onto the beach and flying around the dunes. I went to the backside of the island and found them in the low brush. It was only 60 degrees so they were grouped together in clumps . I had to run 2 miles home to get my camera and bike. When I got back they had moved back further so I traipsed through the brush in the dunes and found them in every bush. They were starting to warm up and were starting to fly around. I believe they are starting to go toward the intercoastal waterway. I think the hurricane delayed them.Bird Island NC Coastal Reserve is adjacent to Sunset Beach, NC on the border of north and South Carolina. It is a 2 1/2 mile walk on the beach to get to it. I have been seeing monarchs sporadically all summer. I just moved here on the island. The hurricane compromised the dunes so access to the back side of the island is easier. Previously you could not walk on the dunes. The trees grow in clusters and when I went back this afternoon I found dozens of clusters with monarchs. I will try and get back early in the morning (10/12) when they are less active and get a count. The ones I saw on the beach were all moving toward the trees.

Our university has two dedicated butterfly gardens that include Gregg's Blue Mist, milkweed, aster, turk's cap, salvia, lantana and roses - all of those are still in bloom - as well as vitex trees. One of those gardens is at my building - we've had a lot of individual monarchs and queens here, but I haven't seen any roosts (no big trees here).

113656,1477419119,2016-10-22,Monarch Fall Roost,500,38.064,-76.343,1,"One of my coworker naturalists here at Calvert County Natural Resources was there at Point Lookout State Park in Scotland , Maryland on 3 different dates in October to attempt to tag monarchs, and this is the info that he shared with me:On Sunday Oct 16 he saw and tagged only one.  Then on Saturday, Oct 22 when there was a strong North Wind, he saw &amp; tagged 11 butterflies over a 3 hour time period.  On Sunday, Oct 23 in the same spot, there were easily 400-500 monarchs.  In a 2 hour time period, he had used up all of his 100 tags, and a volunteer with 25 tags used an unknown number of tags.  He said that for every one he tagged, there were 4-5 that he missed (thus the 400-500 monarch estimate).  Initially, the monarchs were roosting high up in the pines but as the temperatures rose, they began flying out of the trees.  According to my coworker, there was a pretty steady west wind (appx 15mph) and temperatures were in the upper 50s to mid 60s.  It was a sunny day and the smoke from a nearby house fire didn&rsquo;t seem to deter them.  The butterflies were mainly flying, and a few were nectaring on thistle and asters.At my house an hour north of Pt Lookout State Park on the 23rd, I was surprised to see 3 monarchs at 10:30am because it was very windy and still a chilly 55 degrees, but I didn&rsquo;t see any more that day.  Across the bay from my house at Ocean City, Maryland, I noticed that people were reporting sightings of 400-500 monarchs that weekend too. Over the last 2 years since I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of my monarch sightings, I have noticed that we have seen the most monarchs at parks, farms, and houses that border rivers and the Chesapeake Bay, and it seems like our peak migration is mid-October. Some of my notes from last year that may interest you, someone who worked at Pt lookout State Park tagged over 200 monarchs the week of Oct 12-16, 2015.  One of her tags was recovered this winter.  Two coworkers each saw one monarch at 2 different locations along the Patuxent River in Maryland on Dec 15, 2015. I will see if anyone in my coworker&rsquo;s group got some pictures that they&rsquo;d be willing to share from the 23rd at Pt. Lookout State Park so that you can post a picture.Editor's note: We've re-dated this report from 10/23 to 10/22, the night the roost formed.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9993760,500.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

A roost of about 400 at Dangerous Currents sign on West Path looking directly into the interior; a bit further south toward Tip there were 7 smaller roosts totalling about 400 monarchs.

There are soybean and corn fields nearby.  It had been in the mid-sixties overnight and the wind had been quite brisk all the day before--thus I was surprised that the clusters of Monarchs had arrived.  When I am tagging (or observing like yesterday) I notice where the butterflies gather.  I find wind tunnels produced by buildings and obstructions to the south are usually devoid of butterflies.

There is a small glade facing the east where they will also gather whether the wind is from the north or the south.

The perimeter is a mix of cedar hedge, native deciduous trees, fruit trees (no spray) and a wildflower border (New England Asters in full bloom) planted by Mother Nature. On the west there is a large Cottonwood and an 8 foot fence beyond which is a brick commercial building. These items provide a significant wind break.

More were found in the lee of the house on our three metre cedar hedge on the east side of the property.

There were some visitors who were novices at looking at Monarchs who we were able to assist with finding them. It was great to see more interest.  With a strong North wind all day I thought we would see nothing.

Saw one episode of two small butterflies chasing a monarch off a tree branch.October 8: The first roost we had was Saturday (October 7) and they have been coming in a few at a time every night--just considerably more last night (October 7). I noticed them in the yard in late afternoon, around 5. They finally stopped feeding and started clustering, mostly on mesquites last night, about 6:30--7pm. It was getting dark when I made the count, and only a few were still fluttering in the trees, looking for their spot. Most of them get in clusters hanging down from lower branches; one had 24 butterflies in it. Our 5 acre corner of the fields where we farm is a certified wildlife area with National Wildlife, Xerces, and also a Monarch Waystation. We are located in the midst of wide open fields, now full of cotton about ready to harvest. Very little is blooming, just occasional Mexican hats and a few of the little white native asters. Our yard, however, has sunflowers, lots of blue mist flower, Turks' cap, asters, lantana, salvia, etc. We also leave lots of dead stalks to provide some shelter from wind. We try to be ready for spring and fall migrations. We had a cool front yesterday morning at about 4; daytime temp around 85, last night 55. It warmed quickly this morning. The winds were light by mid-afternoon but had switched to south from earlier when out of the north. The trees are thick enough on the West side of the house in an old pasture to provide good cover from the wind. I think the rare cluster of trees is part of what draws them into our place.

(in Wichita Falls)  I live in Burkburnett, TX and noticed them flying over my house in the daytime at around 6:00pm.  I headed out to Lake Wichita (on the south edge of Wichita Falls) which is where I look for the roost.  They Monarchs began coming into roost at around 5:00pm to 8:00pm.

After a few days of cool, rainy weather we figured there would be pent up numbers ready to move.  At least 6 roost locations.  Biggest clump was high up in a taller tree on the west side of the tree.  Tree was parallel to the Dangerous Current sign.  Took a photograph on my Cannon and when I got home later counted over 500 in that clump alone.

Others had curvatures on the upper edges of their forewings. This one was hanging on in a precarious spot close to the tip. Part of the reason the photograph is blurry is that her chosen plant was moving so much. She was extremely faded, missing many scales, and her wings did not seem to close properly.

More arriving monarchs were observed through the day flitting south around Cactus Field &amp; the Visitor Center. And were seen arriving at the Tip &amp; flitting south across the lake. Observed this evening about 70 monarchs on both east beach trees &amp; in the Hackberry Tree near the Dangerous Current sign. 5 seen from west path on interior trees. Good conditions for migrating Monarchs for the next couple of days.

The area is on the steep, south slope of the Thames River valley and seems to work as a migration conduit for flying things - it does attract migrant raptors as well.Today, I sampled two alfalfa fields and adjacent cultural meadow thick with blooming goldenrod. The alfalfa fields contained est. 3500 individual Monarchs, with an additional 400 to be found in the goldenrod areas. I've never, in 40 years living here, noted such numbers of Monarchs, especially contained in such as small area. There is a long, adjacent treeline that is also attracting hundreds of individuals each night as a roost site. Almost all roosting individuals choose the north side of the treeline and seem to favour bare branches as roost perches.The alfalfa fields still host thousands of Clouded and Orange Sulphur as well as Cabbage White. A nearby meadow has also hosted great numbers of Green Darner, with a max. of 2000 yesterday, with much smaller numbers of Shadow and Lance-tipped Darner.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,0,400.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

We had to leave our car on the mainland, and journeyed over to South Bass island.  My wild-collected monarchs have been eclosing the last 2 days, so I was expecting a surge in adult activity.  The storm revealed their presence, as I found 1000 monarchs taking refuge on the leeward side of the trees at the South Bass Island lighthouse grounds.  This is the largest number I have documented here in 5 years, and I have never seen them roost in this particular location on the grounds.  But it was a perfect location, warm and sheltered from the 20-30 mph winds.  I found the roosts by following 2 monarchs that were nectaring in the adjacent sunflower field.  They flew to the trees, and I followed them as they flitted along the trees looking for a place to roost.  They flew over to the other side of the trees, I pursued them, and as I rounded the tree line I was greeted with hackberry and maple trees filled with clusters.

The water levels are pretty high from a combination of rainfall and lake levels over the past 20 hours. Temps are about 60 degrees F with high humidity. The monarchs are roosting on the western side of the trees out of the wind as much as they can be, but they are still bouncing around like crazy. There are pockets of them low in willows and dogwood, but even more towards the tops of cottonwood and maple trees. They were packed in there so tightly that in spots we thought that the leaves had started to change until we had a closer look! There are also monarchs moving over the marshes in the hundreds. One of the best parts is that the monarchs are resting along the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge's Wildlife Drive and we are able to share this incredible sight with our visitors! Here's a link for the map of the Wildlife Drive (the second page).

Largest one was approximately 200. A footpath extends from the south end of this parking lot following the same row of trees along the western edge of the isthmus that is Pelee.  I travelled down it about 100m or so and was not able to locate any roosts in this area. Curiously they chose the trees adjacent to the asphalt road that runs the length of West Beach.  Winds were increasing as we left the park at closing (sunset.) Branches were being blown down and we were hoping they would hang on.

We were in the midst of a nor'easter so the Monarchs that had flown over Lake Erie had no choice but to roost. There were many independent roosts, but outstanding were the wooded stretches along the dike roads that held mega roosts with strands of smaller roosts that continued for many yards. 6 different dike roads were involved.  I estimated at least 2 million Monarchs. It was a phenomenal day.  I was at the refuge the day before (Saturday 9/8/19), and saw NO roosts.  However, there were reports of some smaller ones.&nbsp; So, in 24 hours, the roosts went from some, (I think it read a count of 1,000 individuals or more) to the exponential numbers that I saw.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would guess there were 50 roosts (several dozen). &nbsp;I stopped counting the roosts after the first 12 and figured I was less than 1/3 the way through the refuge auto-tour. &nbsp;The bulk of the roosts were further north which was the last 2/3s of the tour. &nbsp;Roosts were spread out &amp; thin for the first 1/4 or 1/3 of the tour. &nbsp;(<a href=""https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526365899c.jpg""> See map.</a> Understand, the start of the auto-tour is at the southern edge off Route 2 and swings west/north/east back and forth thru the roads, then the final western stretch is basically just off the shoreline to the exit.) The <a href=""https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526365899b.jpg"">massive roosts</a> were at one point 100 ft (approx??) off the lakeshore that had pounding waves and 35mph+ sustained winds. All the monarchs were on the leeward side of the woods that sat between the road and the shoreline. &nbsp;A perfect scenario for them to find shelter immediately coming in off the lake. &nbsp;Weather notes for 9/9/2018:  2 pm-4:15 pm is when I saw them. &nbsp;63F 100% sky cover &nbsp; 4:15pm raining and I left at 4:30pm. &nbsp;Winds over the lake were at least NE 35mph sustained. &nbsp;Winds inside the refuge ranged from NE 10-25 mph depending on location. &nbsp;I believe the overnight temps were in the mid-high 50F s with rain in the am through 12pm.&nbsp;There are no nectar sources in that area of the refuge but along the southern refuge roads were <a href=""https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526365899d.jpg"">these sunflowers</a> - I do not know the common or Latin name. (The photo taken 9/8/18 along a southern road.)&nbsp; There were several large fields in full bloom waiting for them! &nbsp;Also, there was some goldenrod but not nearly as much as the sunflower.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have counted Butterflies for the OH Leps long term study program for over 14 years including Karner Blues and just this year, the Dakota Skipper in MN, for The Nature Conservancy as a volunteer so I knew on Sunday I needed to photo &amp; write down as much as I could before it escaped me.&nbsp; I took over 400 photos in those 2 hours, wonder if any of those monarchs have a tag on them?&nbsp; Finding Waldo?&nbsp; More so, Tuesday (yesterday, 9/11/18), we had mostly sunny skies and 74F dry. &nbsp;No doubt the monarchs found their way to the nectar fields not long after taking flight in the morning after warming. &nbsp;I have over 400 photos and posted 50 on Flickr.

We built a lodge in a big tree grove. As we drove along the grove on Labor Day (9/3/18) the trees were full! There were hundreds and hundreds hanging in each tree. How can we quantify? I don&rsquo;t know! Let&rsquo;s say we have 150 trees along the road. Maybe 30 were full of monarchs, hundreds and hundreds per tree! They were always on the lower levels, not high up in cottonwoods. It would be a safe underestimate to say we had 15,000 just along our driveway (30 trees X 500 butterflies per tree = 15,000).But this isn&rsquo;t all. We have another grove 4 miles south of here and THOSE trees were full, and the neighbor&rsquo;s trees were full too.

Started as school teacher, always liked butterfly in the We had a lot of rain, a dozen lakes, some miles long, lots have &lsquo;sunflowers&rsquo; &ndash; but otherwise the butterflies were just sitting on the cottonwoods. We don&rsquo;t have anything that attracts butterflies. We have a lot of regal fritillaries, some buckeyes, but we see very few butterflies so were completely surprised by the monarchs.There was NO WIND all week which is very unusual for the Sandhills. The butterflies looked fresh, not tattered at all. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526366480.jpg,9710973,15000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

But they are reporting seeing thousands of monarchs this past weekend on their Facebook page.  ""Innumerable monarchs"" showed up on West Beach on 9-8-18, staying 3 days before leaving their roosts.  Here are some comments from their Facebook posts:""On September 6th the wind finally shifted to the north and we started to see some new migrants. Thirty-one birds of 10 species were banded and a total of fifty species was recorded. There were quite a few Swainson&rsquo;s Thrushes and Yellow-bellied Flycatchers in the netting area and a late Yellow Warbler was observed among a group of warblers on the census. Migratory Bald Eagles are coming through the area too.On September 7th we heard numerous flight calls of thrushes flying over when we got out of the car at Fish Point. We banded 86 birds of 17 species (41.25 net hours) including the fall&rsquo;s first Gray-cheeked Thrush and Purple Finch. A total of 66 species were recorded including 17 warbler species, a Swamp Sparrow, and a Hudsonian Godwit during the standard count period.The wind got stronger and gusted up to 20 knots today, September 8th. We opened nets for a couple of hours and observed some Gray-cheeked and other thrushes, but decided not to bother the birds under the bad weather conditions. Trees were squeaking above us everywhere. Census was done as usual, but more than that, there were innumerable Monarchs in the sky and tree branches at the west beach! At the same time there were millions of stable flies at the tip and they started circling around me on my way back.(photo: Monarch Butterfly)https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1742826595815268&amp;id=334082646689677Also a post stating: ""We banded 93 birds of 14 species this morning including 35 Swainson&rsquo;s and six Gray-cheeked Thrushes - 2.4 birds/net hour! There were lots of Red-breasted Nuthatches, Black-throated Blue Warblers and Ovenbirds. A Wilson&rsquo;s and a Western Palm Warbler were new for the season. A total of 57 species were recorded during the standard count period. For the last two days we couldn&rsquo;t open nets, but the census was done and 36 species were recorded, including 10 warbler species, on the 8th and a total 47 species, including 11 warbler species, on the 9th. The thousands of Monarchs waited almost three days for better wind conditions at Fish Point. They finally started flying around and going up high once the sun showed up. Lots of them were moving over the lake. I didn&rsquo;t see any dead Monarchs from the bad weather on my census during these three days, which reminded me how important the mature forest can be for sheltering many different creatures during bad weather conditions. Good luck to the Monarchs!

Fantastic! Our monarch count is an estimate. My friend said "" thousands"", but I was going to say 500-1000. They were everywhere! Made me so happy ...and it was rewarding, to see that my efforts in converting a fallow field to native prairie, were attracting and feeding these beauties! Prior to the native planting, we were stunned to see our old oak tree covered with monarchs one evening ...at first I thought the leaves had all turned brown.  As we got closer, it was just breathtaking. I was hooked! Hoped each year to catch it again, but with our timing or their flight pattern, we haven't had a repeat.

Flushed Monarchs from the outside of several Live Oaks and Ashe Junipers.  Also saw less than 5 more high overhead.  All the large roost friendly trees I checked had Monarchs.  I did not find many up inside trees or inside groves. Easily flushed.  Not in Groups.  None seeking nectar except the ones earlier.  Lots of Liatris in bloom and many other flower species. So getting ready to setrtle in but not there.   At the same times many other butterfly species were actively feeding.  Thousands of Queens (Danaus gilippus) many of the larger size common this late in the year.  Mostly feeding on King Ranch Bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum var. songarica) inflorescences (the grass version of flowers). King Ranch Bluestem is growing unusually well with all the rain this year.  Unfortunately it is a non-native invasive that is hard to control. Queens and Common buckeyes and a million small moths seemed to prefer it to the Liatris growing with it.  But I digress. I am writing this the day after.

I went the following evening to take some photos of them, and I had noticed there were more (around 35).  I went back the 3rd evening and there were 100+.  There were more than I could physically count, and they were perching and flying around.  It was quite a site!  By the 4th evening they had started to leave, but there were a few remaining or coming through for a few more days after still.

Initially monarchs arrived from the north over the western shoreline on the west side of the Tip &amp; quickly zipped inland over west path &amp; continued south to interior trees or toward the Tip. A few stopped to nectar on Thistle &amp; in the small meadow on Bouncing Bet/Soapwort. About a 1/2 dz attempted to venture out south over the very calm east side but after entering open water &amp; encountering strong westerly wind they retreated back to the treeline. And the east side has some beach again so I was able to observe activity there. Numerous monarchs were flitting amongst the trees on east side &amp; interior trees as well. Mosquitoes were horrible! Upon returning to parking lot observed at about 8:11 pm clusters forming in Hackberry trees with branches cascading over Tip Shuttle stop (A common area for early Sept clusters) They were also on bare branches &amp; on cascading grapevine.

Monarchs were all over the island, we literally had to swerve to miss them as we drove our golf cart down island main roads. We started at the State Park, doing MLMP. Maya and I found several eggs, larvae and 1 adult, after having not seen anything at this location all summer until now. We enjoyed seeing ants farming aphids, and a 5th instar monarch and a tussock moth caterpillar feeding together on the same common milkweed leaf. The monarch 5th instar had chewed the leaf petiole to cut off the latex, and both caterpillars were enjoying the leaf. Two campers joined us to see what we were doing, and we had an impromptu monarch lesson for them. We also ended up doing an impromptu lesson on the Lake Erie water snake for a family who encountered a snake sunning itself on the rocks--they were quite fearful of it at first but our lesson helped them understand its nature and allayed their fears.State Park milkweed patch data:72-75F, winds light from the West 10am-10:45am checked the 5 plants we could reach3 eggs, 2 2nds on 1 plant1 tussock, 1 5th, 1 egg on 1 plant1 5th, 1 egg, 1 2nd on 1 plant1 2nd, 1 tussock, 2 eggs on 1 plant2 eggs on 1 plant1 adultWe then drove to East Point preserve. On the way, from 10:50 to 11:10am, we saw 6 monarch adults in a 1.2 mile stretch from the State Park to Perry's monument. 80F, winds picking up to West at 10mph; 1 monarch headed SW in directional flight flew up the windshield of our golf cart as we drove down Langram Rd.11:15am 2 more adults on drive to East Point 1pm 1 adult nectaring in garden by Goat Tavern as we had lunch3pm We went to the lighthouse grounds, and saw 4 adults on the perimeter of the sunflower field and 2 in the Waystation garden in 10 minutes. 2 more near roosting location on lighthouse grounds trying to take cover from increasing west wind--Jackie Taylor was netting monarchs in the Waystation garden for her Kelley's island monarch program; winds were light in the sunflower field on the leeward side of the tree line, but 10-14mph near the island's tip by the lighthouse.We returned to the lighthouse grounds 6:30-7pm to look for roosts.&nbsp; We found seven monarchs roosting on the leeward side of the tree line, 2 were a mated pair resting in a hackberry tree by themselves; 5 tried to form a cluster together but males repeatedly broke it up by fighting with each other over females; there were 3 adults nectaring in the sunflower field, the patrolling male there repeatedly attempted to intercept a nectaring female near the lone milkweed clone in the field; 3 adults in the Waystation garden at the lighthouse, a male was repeatedly pursuing a heavily worn female by bopping her repeatedly from above and trying to pounce on her as she nectared, while the other lone monarch made a beeline over the cliff edge out of sight headed south. It may have headed out over the lake but I couldn't see over the brush from where I was. 80F with 7mph W winds with gusts up to 14 mph, sunnyIce ramp milkweed patch: checked briefly from 7:05-7:15pm5 eggs on 1 stem, I did not have time to check any more milkweed but snapped a few photos of the patch.The premigration has clearly arrived to the island!Photos here https://www.flickr.com/photos/candy__kasey/albums/72157710218058996",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/08/1526412945.jpg,9942133,7.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

They were roosting in the trees. I found them about 11am. I went back in the evening around 7pm and most of them were already gone. Editor&rsquo;s note: We have contacted the observer to confirm details of this roost. Additional comments from observer: Date: Sunday 8-18-19 between 10:15am and 11:00 am. I did an estimate by counting the number of Monarchs on 1 extended branch and than counting the number of branches that were similarly full on the tree.  I then multiplied the amount by the number of trees that were occupied. I did not account for Monarchs that were flying overhead or outside the main roosting area. I am not sure about the nectar source. There is a decent amount of Milkweed along the dirt road leading to the wooded area. I think there is a field of beets on the Northern side. Temperatures: it was a chilly morning, around 55 degrees when I started my day and I was wearing a long sleeve shirt...but it warmed up just enough after I found the roost and it was over 60 degrees for sure. It was definitely cooler where they were at though and there had to be a 5 degree difference from the sunshine to this shaded area. I would say 63 degrees outside the roost and 58 degrees in the shade.  Wind direction was a breezy wind 10-15 MPH I believe out of the south.

The butterflies on the north side of the field (scattered red clover) were roosting singly and in pairs mostly.  I used my binoculars to spot some monarchs that were crossing the road about &frac14; of a mile south, so I decided to drive down there and see if the large trees in that lawn area might be forming a cluster.  It was probably 7:30 when I made that move, giving me about half an hour before the sun set.  The first tree was empty, but there were butterflies flying around some fruit trees in the yard and after about 5 minutes I spotted the cluster forming above me in a large maple.  Two clusters formed very close together (see photo).The nectar source was a long narrow field, perhaps 40 acres of unmown hay, but not much alfalfa.  I had spotted enough red clover there two days before to know that monarchs might use it for nectaring.Temps went from 70s to 60s while I was there, then ended up at about 50 degrees in the night.Wind was from the Northwest the first night (Wednesday, 8/21); Thursday it was mainly Northeast.  On Wednesday, the monarchs were on the southeast side of the maple, so the lee side, shielded.  Eventually it died down to near calm.  Thursday was less wind, mostly calm from 7 o&rsquo;clock until I left at 8:30.  Monarchs were sheltered in the small roost I saw at the north end of the red clover field.Most of the monarchs were gone since the night before.  I suspect 90% of them migrated with the north wind today.I did see one small roost of six and another of 12 so still had some fun.Writing this on 8/24........last night saw no Monarchs at that site, but did see one lone monarch in an alfalfa field to the south.

I counted 182 and there were many more coming in for the evening.  My neighbor noted that they were all facing west and that maybe this was so they could open their wings to the sun rising in the East in the morning.  Most of them were sitting really low.  I was surprised to see them 5 to 6 feet from the ground.  They were in small groups on sumac, oak trees, pine tree and some kind of shrub, all along the bluff above the Mississippi river. Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingObserver's response: I first noticed the roost on the afternoon of August 28th.There are numerous nectar sources nearby including a prairie planting in the park, along the bluff just a couple hundred feet from the roost.  There are lots of golden rod blooming and different types of yellow cone flowers and other yellow daisy like flowers, however, there are few monarchs on these plants.   My neighborhood across from the park covering about a 4 by 5 block area is loaded with gardens in the yard and on boulevards and there are many milkweed plants and fall nectar plants that monarchs favor.  My neighbor had 75 to a 100 monarchs on her blazing star and Mexican sun flower just a couple of days ago.The over night temperature was 54 degrees last night and 57 degrees the night before.  The wind the last three days has been W 15-18 MPH with gusts to 28 miles per hour.  The monarchs roost was sheltered from the wind.  They were located on shrubs on the inside edge of the bluff, on the grassy side of the park.  Backing the shrubs was a whole forest of trees going down the bluff to the Mississippi river..   You approached the roost across grass up an incline and into a slightly bowed area and you could feel the wind die away.

This morning [Sep 3]  there was no butterfly at all.Most of the observations has been made by Michel Fortin, our farm manager, who is doing his morning tour of experimental plots around 7:30-8:00 am.On August 29, we arrived just before the sunset (7:00 pm) and stayed there for 45 min. It was impossible to count them all&hellip;We are pretty sure that we saw about 1,500 individuals, but we estimated the population at 10,000 monarchs&hellip;they were all over the rows of spruce. Just in front, there was a field of buckwheat in bloom and we observed the monarchs feeding on them.The overnight temperature was 15&deg;C, low wind (between 5 and 10 Km/h), wind direction: South.Some of the monarchs were facing north in the spruce, but there was also other clusters facing south.",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/08/1526418578.jpg,10021677,1500.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

The numbers of monarchs in the flats during the day was much higher than I've seen other years. I was able to locate  two roosts on two branches of the same tall poplar tree - facing East. Another half dozen butterflies were circling, leaving and coming back as dark approached.  I first saw roosts on the evening of August 30th - but that's because it was the first time I went looking.   The Dolan flats where this large tree is on the west side of the perimeter, is a swampy area that is full of pollinators all summer.  Right now the most visible nectar sources are Joe Pye weed and Goldenrod.Both evenings, there was almost no breeze.   The roosts are all on the East side of the tree where the sun will find it early in the day.Overnight temperatures were around 15 degrees Celcius both nights.  The branches are towards the inside of the tree so I'd guess that gave them maximum protection.I used binoculars to count the individuals - those already in the roost and those flying around.  It's a conservative estimate since I found 3 roosts very high up, so in all likelihood there were more than 50, most especially as it appeared there was a 4th roost that I couldn't see on the 31st but butterflies were flying around that location which was a bit more inside the tree, on it's south-west side.Today is a rainy day so I'm not expecting to see much.",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9990969,50.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

There is one maple that has been very popular when south wind.  For example, 9/1 and 9/2 south wind, yes set up in the same general area.  They certainly seem to &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; out each other.As for nectar plants...they particularly like my two huge plots of zinnias and Tithonia.  I also have tropical and swamp milkweed currently blooming which is another hotspot.  Planted as plugs so seem to be blooming later.  Other annuals available are lantana and marigolds.  Plus goldenrod is blooming in ditches.  Asters and sedum just starting to bloom.

I estimate there were well over around 1,000 butterflies, because they were spread out over 4-5 trees, with 5-10 still arriving every 5-6 mins. There are lot's of nectar sources near by, there is actually a butterfly garden just east of their location, and a large park, with goldenrod that's just blooming. The night time temp's were aprox 7-9 deg for the past week or so near me, sometimes dropping a bit lower than that. The wind direction was SSW but I live right by Lake Ontario so it changes  during the day several times.. They were sheltered from the wind, on the side of the tree's they were on. They were all facing East though, I was guessing that they were going to take advantage of the sun coming up the next morning.  I also want to add that I was up in the Georgian Bay (Balm Beach) area yesterday and there were tons of Monarch Butterflies heading out over the water heading South. I must have seen 100+ yesterday alone. It's been a very very good year for them in Ontario, because we had great rainfall, and this brings tons of wild flowers everywhere. My husband was also on Georgian bay in a boat 2 weekends ago and the butterflies were landing on the boat to rest. He said there were hundreds of them out over the water too. He was in the Lion's Head area. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526420844.jpg,9978116,1000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

No significant numbers noted just groups of 5 or 6. Always on the north side of the tree lines though.  On the east side of Leamington where Essex Road 33 intersects with Essex Road 34 at the southeast corner as we were driving through the intersection I saw some Monarch activity in a grove of trees left to Mother Nature. We turned around, parked on the shoulder of the road and ventured onto the property at approximately 19:30. Monarchs were flitting about everywhere and more were arriving from  the direction of an Oversized  Greenhouse Complex flying at tree top height south across Essex Road 34. Some had already established their roosts. All the monarchs we observed arriving joined larger already established roosts. Roosts were noted in six separate very mature trees (Pine, 2 Spruce, Mulberry, Apple and Oak) on the north side of each tree except the Oak which had a dozen on its west side . In the Pine, Spruce and Oak all the roosts were relatively low on the tree.  In the Apple and Mullberry the roosts were near the top.   The largest and most tightly clustered roost was in the Mulberry tree which was also the furthest south (300.)  173 in the Pine, 150 in the Apple.  Temperature was 19°C according to my dashboard.  No clouds. No notable wind. It had been a beautiful sunshiny day in Essex County. Forecast low of 12 with a dew point of 13. This grove of trees has an abundance of goldenrod just beginning to bloom should they need nectar in the morning. Counting was done visually cluster by cluster using my binoculars and calling out the counts to my son who had the calculator.  A family who was on the way back from a journey to Point Pelee to see Monarchs noticed us and the Monarchs and stopped to take some photos. We shared our observations with them and they were quite pleased, as were we.    ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9968455,733.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

I hoped the weather might make monarchs take cover on the island. But as it warmed up, I became more doubtful.We headed over to Gibraltar island to visit Cooke's Castle and Stone Lab. Monarchs were sailing over the water, and we watched them fly across the island at tree top level in a southwest direction. We saw 9 monarchs on the 6-acre island in 2 hours time. It made me hopeful, so after we returned to South Bass island, we headed for the lighthouse grounds.We found 260 monarchs scattered along the driveway next to the treeline, and 100 more nectaring in the sunflower field!  They were scattered in clusters of 2-4 dozen all along the drive, mostly in the hackberry trees about 15-25 feet up.I spotted a tagged monarch, but my aging Rebel camera managed only blurry pictures in the low light.

The wind was from the north and the butterflies were gone the next day.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingI have been checking the grove of trees for several days.  I check in the morning about 9, again around noon and later in the afternoon usually between 3 and 4.  Last Thursday (9/5/19) I had done the first 2 checks and seen 5 or 6 Monarchs.  When I checked at 3, it was immediately obvious that there were more.  The Monarchs roost on the north and south side of a grove of walnut, ash, choke cherry trees with evergreen trees and dogwood shrubs in the interior of the grove.  Thursday afternoon I skirted the perimeter.  There were several large clumps of Monarchs.  I counted 2 of the clumps at 28 and probably 36 (due to some taking flight, it had to be a guess)  I multiplied the number of clumps I had seen by 25 and reported at least 150.  The overnight temperatures were in the 50s.  I am never sure about the Monarch's choice of roosting sites.  Because there are many trees and micro-climes among and between the trees, it is hard to say, but I often find them on the south side of the trees, but the perimeter and the roost would be described on the north side.  There is a soybean field directly to the north and the Monarchs come from the north above the soybeans so the trees are the first they encounter.  If we have a south wind while they are here, they flutter about, sometimes nectaring on Black-eyed Susan blooms, sedum, phlox.  But they roost much more frequently than they nectar.

Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingThe monarch gathering was witnessed Sunday 9/8/19 from  2:30-4:00 p.m. on a cool, drizzly day.  The high temp was about 70 degrees. The previous night was in the 50&rsquo;s and there were storms. Not much wind. There was protection from wind and rain. The monarchs were along a row of pine trees lining a hiking trail at F.W. Kent Park where my husband and I were hiking with our dog.  They were not congregated all together but rather scattered along the line of pine trees. On the other side of the trail is reestablished  prairie full of flowers. It was a great location!  Protection on one side of the trail and nectar in the other!   I estimated the number based on seeing monarchs flying off of tree after tree, as we walked past. In addition, we saw about a half dozen small resting spots.  For sure we saw hundreds of butterflies. We noticed them creating new resting spots in the pines when we were walking out.  I&rsquo;ve been raising monarchs for years so this was quite a thrill to see. <iframe width=""400"" height=""225"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPE6f7hkogo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526422086.jpg,10009232,1000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

Sept. 9 to Sept. 16. They are always in my view,  5 to 7 at a time.  The neighbours noticed them roosting about 6 pm on Sept . 11th, 2019.  I went down our street (about 500 feet off the  beach) about 7 pm.  It was about 75 &lsquo; F.  I watched them streaming inland for about an hour till it was dark and they were still coming in and landing on maple trees and pine trees filling the branches.  As they landed they would cause a few butterflies to shift position and flutter around the branches before settling down again.  They were still resting on the tree branches in the morning before 8 am.  100&rsquo;s of butterflies were in each tree.  There were about 7 or 8 trees covered with the monarchs.  So I guessed 1000.

The lake was fairly calm and the wind was out of the north. Many were feeding on fall flowers in my yard and neighbouring yards.  It was not unusual to see 8 to 10 at a time in my yard any time of the day and/or flying south down the street from the beach. Nectar sources were scarce near the beach/roost trees and that is likely why they were visiting the neighbours yards this week ...150 to 600 feet off the beach.The trees the monarch choose to roost in each night were about 200 feet off the beach. There were 2 or 3 rows of trees and row of houses between their roost trees and the beach. They would have some shelter from the wind.

They started filtering in around 5:00 p.m. with peak numbers showing up around 6:30 p.m. Estimate at least 300, but groups are scattered amongst the many evergreens so totals are hard to tell. GREAT to have them back for a nightly visit and looking forward to tomorrow night to see if numbers hold.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sighting1. The first large roost formed on Monday, September 16th.2. The Monarchs who congregated on Monday night were quick to roost in groups. We live on one acre of land and it is almost entirely covered by either deciduous or evergreen trees. We noticed last year during the roost that the Monarchs have a couple of 'favorite' places so we always began our searches there once we saw them filtering in. Large clumps were easy to spot so we did actual counts of their size. This would routinely be around 20 -30 members. We would then take note of smaller groups and single visitors and roughly add those numbers in. The reason I mention about the number of trees we have is because there is so much canopy to survey that I know we are underestimating numbers. It's just too tricky in the evening twilight to see them all. We always get out early the next morning to see if there were any groups that we overlooked the night before. So numbers based on actual counts plus a small estimate of stragglers.3. I am happy to report that our yard is slowly becoming one big nectar source. I have dedicated about 1/4 of my yard to a naturalized flower area that contains milkweed, coneflower, rudbeckia, daisy, salvia, Russian sage, goldenrod, phlox, and soon to have liatris. Also, while we are surrounded on three sides by farm fields, there is a drainage ditch running along the fourth and it's banks are filled with all sorts of indigenous plants (as well as being a calm water source).4. Our yard is located in a floodplain so overnight temperatures are always a degree or two cooler than surrounding areas. Monday night got down to 60 degrees F, with lows the rest of this week ranging from 57 to 63 degrees F.5. On Monday night the breeze was light and from the ENE at around 5 mph. The light to calm wind conditions have continued through the week and have ranged from calm to maybe 5 mph around the time the Monarchs settle in. Daytime breezes were a bit higher, but never exceeding 7 - 10 mph. Wind direction has been from the east, to briefly from the south and east, to almost calm last night. The yard is completely sheltered from the wind with the north and west sides ringed with large arborvitae, white pine and Norway spruce. The east side is home to a large silver maple, a large bald cypress and a hackberry tree. Crabapple and Cleveland pear trees run along the south with assorted others throughout the yard. Late arrivals seem to prefer the maple and cypress on the east side of the yard, while the typical favorite spot is tucked into the northwest corner where the arbs and spruces come together. Less roosting in the evergreens this year as a whole and more in the deciduous trees; especially the silver maples.",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526425133.jpg,10012053,300.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

We started to notice large amounts of them late August and they have grown in numbers steadily over the last couple of weeks. We have a huge patch of clover growing in the field behind us and several trees surrounding the fields that they are nesting in. The sighting was documented and 6 butterflies we tagged by Kylee Baumle 9/17/19. Image courtesy of Kylee BaumleEditor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingI can definitely verify that they were roosting here on August 29th. The picture is of the tail end of a swarm of butterflies I saw while I was mowing by the trees. It was taken on August 29th. At that time I would guess there were hundreds in that area of my yard. I never really checked the other side of my yard so I couldn&rsquo;t tell you if they were roosting there also at that time. It seems like they are staying close to mostly mine and my close neighbors' trees. The neighbors a little down the road had no idea they were here because the seem to stay in this area. I had Kylee estimate the number of butterflies because she&rsquo;s more of an expert than me. All of mine and my neighbors' trees are absolutely full of them. When she came back for a second visit we both questioned the original estimate of 5,000 that I gave you because we went out at sunrise and the amount seemed more. We decided each tree had at least hundreds in them and a few had to have had at least a thousand. We have a little over 20 trees on both properties.

It wasn't thick like some pictures I've seen, but it was easily in the hundreds. The picture is dark, but if you zoom in, you can see about 10 monarchs. Prettiest thing ever!Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingI don't know when the roost first formed.  It's on a part of our property that I don't frequent. I was out mowing ... about 11:30 am ... I rounded the corner behind our neighbor's fence and started mowing along the treeline.  Suddenly, a swarm of monarchs flew up.  I steered away from the thicket immediately and shut off the mower. I called for my daughter - she ran out to me, thinking I was hurt, but when she saw the butterflies, she gasped. I visited the site (about 50 yards behind our house) several times over the next few hours.  Through the day, the numbers dwindled as those trees received more sunlight.  By the time my husband got home at about 4:30 pm, almost all of them were gone.  He was sad he hadn't seen it.Standing in one place, looking at the most narrow portion of the thicket (about 20' x 30'), I counted well over 100.  That was just counting the ones I could actually see clearly.  There were more on the other side of the thicket, but I wasn't sure which were monarchs and which were dead leaves on limbs that had fallen.  The thicket between the fields runs for probably two football lengths, and I saw fluttering the whole way down. I think 500 was a very conservative estimate.Nectar sources nearby? The field to the west of the thicket is full of clover and alfalfa. The field to the east is fallow this year, but it's full of wild asters, clover, and a few other wildflowers.  There is a walnut grove also just to the left of the thicket that is full of goldenrod.  There are many houses around that have lots of zinnias and other flowers blooming.Overnight temps probably around 67F. Winds SSW. We live in a county with over 2000 people and 511 windmills. It is ALWAYS windy here. The monarchs were somewhat shielded from the wind.  The thicket runs north/south.  The butterflies didn't start clustering until about 10-15 feet into the thicket.

Tagged 100 in short orderEditor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingIt has been a wonderful season for monarchs!  I have tagged them the last four years, usually going out on 4+ occasions and lucky if I get 60 tags completed.  This year it took me 3 short visits to tag 100 and I could've done lots more.When did the roost first form? I visited the Badger Prairie park on 9/11 around 3pm and saw several hundred flying and feeding on goldenrod (tagged 25 in less than an hour). I did not witness the roost that day.  On 9/13 there was a post on Facebook from a gentleman that said hundreds were roosting at the park at 5pm.  Hi Temp that day was 70F, evening low 57F.  The only evening I witnessed the roost was 9/15, it was muggy and calm, temps were 74F, evening 64F.  I returned to the park on 9/17 and the goldenrod was past peak and I didn't see many monarchs, far fewer than 2 days prior.  How did you estimate 1000? There were at least 10 clumps of monarchs, each clump with at least 100.  When guessing again, I would say there could've been 3000.  The trees were filled with monarchs and this was just one area of the park ( Badger Prairie park is about 300 acres).  We witnessed the roost around 6:45 pm, after sunset, when it was getting pretty dark so it was pretty difficult to see how many were in the trees.  Also, the gentleman (from the Facebook post) saw the monarchs at a different part of the park, if they were there as well, then this park probably had 4000! The roost I saw was in a treeline at the southern end of the park, winds were SW at 5mph  (data taken from weather underground).  The treeline is not very protected but not very high up either. See video below. One other thing: On 9/20, as I was supervising the playground about 1 mile from Badger Prairie park, we saw a pretty constant stream of monarchs heading south - in an hour we saw 35 monarchs (the kids loved it).

As we walked up to the thicket, a clap of thunder sounded, and probably fifty swarmed up then settled back down.  There were a few (25?) flitting about among the goldenrod under the walnut trees, but as the rain picked up, everyone was hunting cover.This has been a wonderful week!  I feel so blessed to be seeing this!The folks who used to own this property sprayed and sprayed in order to have a perfect lawn.  We had no bees, no butterflies, no fireflies the first year.

They said they've been there for three days (heavy rainstorms with some sun). Mostly gone as of 9/20/19.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingThe monarchs were roosting in my friend's neighbor's yard starting on Tuesday, Sept. 17th. She saw monarchs flying around on the 16th but the roost was discovered on the 17th in the afternoon. I observed the roost on Thursday, Sept. 19th (the photo submitted with this report was taken that day). They roosted in those trees until Sunday, Sept. 22nd according to my friend. As far as number estimation on my Sept 19th observation, there are 3 or 4 conifers in her back yard, each about 50 feet tall, with 2 or 3 branches per tree covered with monarchs. So if there were 200-250 butterflies per tree, that would be between 600 and 1000 butterflies. However, my friend reports that her observation on the evening of the 17th had probably twice the number of monarchs that I saw on the afternoon of 19th, with many on lower hanging branches. Interestingly, there were other types of conifers immediately adjacent to the roost but no monarchs on those...they clearly preferred this particular type of conifer! We observed one mating pair on Sept 19th afternoon as well. We aren't aware of nectar sources nearby however this is a residential neighborhood with lots of flower gardens. I personally have a small pollinator garden in my yard, 1/4 mile away, but only saw an occasional monarch floating through my yard.Here are overnight low temps and 24H max wind speeds. The wind direction was generally SE on most of these days, lots of rain, and yes, the trees and houses provided protection from the wind.Sept 17 (all early mornings temps): 69F/17mphSept 18: 69F/17mphSept 19: 70F/15mphSept 20: 67F/15mphSept 21: 73F/20mphSept 22: 66F/ 16mph After sharing my photos on FB, a friend mentioned that on Sept 8, they released 1,000 monarchs for a hospice fundraiser probably 3 or 4 miles away. Not sure if they were tagged monarchs but we didn't see any tags (not that we would necessarily know what what to look for). Finally, my friend's neighbor emailed these details about their departure on the 22nd: ""The butterfly departure was in full swing on Sunday afternoon following the rain.   They started by spreading their wings to dry out and then there were a few test flights.   By evening the butterflies were nearly all gone after the cooler temperatures and the light winds arrived.""

These were trees on the north side of the ditch and I didn&rsquo;t think to look at the trees along the bank at the time and I also didn&rsquo;t take note the weather at the time other than it was really windy.  We took a few photos and video and the grandkids all took a walk through the trees.  They butterflies were everywhere.  About half in trees and the others were flying around.  Sunday evening around 6 p.m., my daughter and I went to see if any were still in the trees and that is when we noticed the trees along the bank had lots and lots of monarchs settling in for the night.  Most every limb along the 400-500 feet had monarchs roosting.  My daughter took photos with a better camera.  It was hard to get pics as many of the limbs were low hanging. Some branches had 30-40 each best I could count. Again it was windy.  Sunday night it began raining around 8pm - not hard but steady for about an hour or so maybe.

I did not check to see if they were still there in the morning, unfortunately. As for a nectar source, there is a ~3acre plot of land about 0.5-0.75 miles away from my home that is natural/untouched. You can tell they removed the trees at one point, however, wildlife has taken back over. There is plenty of golden rod, prairie thistle, and Bergemont that I have observed there in the past, so much of it looks native species to Illinois. I am also ~2 miles away from a forest preserve and nature preserve as well (Buffalo Trace nature preserve and Lake of the Woods forest preserve), both of which are actively being restored to natural prairie. Overnight temperatures were around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. I looked back at the forecast and it was an unusually quiet day wind wise for us.

How did you estimate the number of adults?  That is just a wild guess.   Ha...    There were way too many to count.   And if a person got to close to a tree, there would be a flurry of them take off and fly around.    There are 20-30 large elm (and other trees) in the main courtyard of the administration building.    It was noticeable to the point that students were stopping to take pictures throughout the courtyard and look at them. Nectar sources nearby? There are some flowering plants in yards around town - but other than milkweed, I'm not familiar with what they'd feed on.Overnight temperatures?    It has been pretty consistent the last week or so to get down to about 60 at night for a low. Wind? Were the monarchs shielded from the wind in this location?    I'm not sure of the wind direction or speed.

It&rsquo;s a small 17 acre island that is The American Museum Of Natural History&rsquo;s Research Station in Long Island Sound. It is the site of one of the largest Tern colonies in the world. They cover it with guano and that helps a large crop of Milkweed and Golden Rod....I&rsquo;ve worked there seasonally for 40 years and saw my first Monarchs roosting there then (about 50) on a cold autumn evening (on a privet bush). We often leave the island on Labor Day, but the last few years I&rsquo;ve been out to the end of September. If you're on Facebook at all, I have a page: My View From Great Gull Island that has photos of the island and wildlife etc. Last year I found a couple of small roosts on the island and kept my eyes out this year for them roosting. In September the island is covered with Monarchs, on the 16th this year I found lots of small groups all over the west end of the island (groups of 3-10 ) on Goldenrod. I also found a small roost of about 30 on the now huge Privet.The next day the group was on the privet but also noticed some in the pine grove close by. Numbers went up and down the next few days but very large group on Saturday the 21 (estimate a thousand plus). The next day most seemed to leave the island and Sunday the 22 was very sparse in the trees (a few hundred). It was a week of good wind, the Monarchs roosted in the downwind side of trees. I have video of them also hanging on to the pines in a squall with heavy wind and rain. I'll post it on My View From Great Gull if I already haven&rsquo;t.The biggest number of about 2000 was on the 27What time of day did you observe this roost?

I'm only estimating how many are here at this moment in time because it was getting too dark to see all of them by the time we finished tagging 50 of them. We walked around the property with flashlights and it was clear that they were still occupying the usual cedar trees in high numbers, though not as densely as when I first saw them on September 17th. Our goal this evening was to use the final 50 Monarch Watch tags I had. With a large net, it was easy to capture them and we could have done many, many more had we had more tags.The monarchs were very robust, strong, and their wings almost felt leathery in comparison to those earlier in the season (the non-migratory).Wings measured from 48mm to 54mm, with most being 50-52mm. Nearly all looked very fresh and undamaged. Abdomens were quite plump, no doubt due to the abundant nectar source adjacent to the site. A large field of blooming clover was to the north and to the west.Weather today was cloudy with intermittent light rain, and warm. It was 70 degrees at the time we first got there at 6:30. Winds were light at about 5 mph and out of the northeast.It seems as if the monarchs will be here until the last possible day before cold weather sets in. It's clearly a favored location, though the owner said it's the first time in over 30 years that they've been there like this. Photo attached is from my second visit to this roost on September 18th, when we spotted a female white monarch.

I hadn't seen any monarchs flying over the highway in our travels, but when we got to WP, there were a few random monarchs sailing around that dirt road and the parking lot at the end of it. There were some settling into the willow tree up the bank north of the parking lot and as I took the trail around next to the river and up the bank, there were some settling in, a few at a time, in the trees and shrubs right near the shore. There was really no wind to speak of...I continued to walk toward the grove of trees near the sand volleyball and saw a few other small roosts forming there.

I was able to see 3 roosts on Sunday.  I live in Aurora, NE.  A friend called me about 4:00 pm and said she had some Monarchs in the tree so I went to see them. I think there could have been a couple hundred in that roost. We tagged 35 of them and there were MANY more that we couldn&rsquo;t easily reach.  Most of those were in a crab apple tree.While leaving that site I was called to the Leadership Center, also in Aurora, NE. That is a camp-like conference grounds on the edge of town. There two of the Educators from the Edgerton Science Center in Aurora spotted a roost at least five times larger than the one I had just visited.  At this site they were hanging in several different varieties of trees. Deb M. (from the Edgerton) still had about 100 tags and I still had 25 so we used all of those.  She estimated the number at a thousand.  Actually there may have been more.   I also found another area about a half mile from that one that had about half as many. I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;raising&rdquo; Monarchs for about 15 years and I have NEVER seen anything like this.  It was glorious!The day was quite windy, partly sunny and in the 80&rsquo;s. It got into the 60&rsquo;s that night.  I went back yesterday afternoon (9/30/19) and there were still some in each of the three locations but not nearly as many. Yesterday it was extremely windy with the wind blowing south to north.  I have no idea how they were able to fly in that wind.All 3 locations were fairly well protected from the wind.

Also observed about a dozen individually arrive from the north on the calm west side closer to the Tip parking lot.Temp of 25&deg;c is forecast for 9/30.

Along the pathway there are Russian olive trees, cotton wood and they are surrounded by farm land that includes alfalfa, wheat, milo, and corn.

Were the monarchs shielded from the wind in this location? The wind was in full force when they roosted. It was probably blowing between 30-50 that day with no real direction.

My camera on my phone is horrible but I submitted the picture regardless to show where the Monarch was. Find the white branch that is vertical in the photograph, follow it up and look immediately left of the tip of the branch and you will see a triangle. That is the Monarch. I turned around and searched the treeline  abutting the shoreline and halfway up a hackberry tree was another single Monarch. I was not able to finish scanning the shoreline as sunset at 18:37 was fast approaching. Both Monarchs were pristine.

That is the best I could do at estimating the number is somewhere between 75 and 100.  They were roosting along our creek in the box elders and mulberry trees. Most left as the day warmed up but there are still about 25 there again this evening (same day). We noticed them first on the morning of September 1st but they had clearly been there the night before roosting in the trees. My husband found them around 9am. Number: my husband felt there were in the hundreds but he was so astonishrd that was maybe an overestimate. Unfortunately he scared them with his lawnmower and many flew higher up in the trees. He came and got me right away and when we went back, many were swirling around. I counted 50 still roosting quietly on the branches that were approximately eye level and estimated somewhere between 25 and 50 more were flying around us. I could see more in a clump up high roosting but no way of knowing how many. Nectar sources: Amazingly enough, we are an official Monarch Waystation so we have been working on increasing our nectar plants as well as host plants. Never in a million years did we expect this happy result in our waystation! That being said, my interest in monarchs stems from an incident about 20 years ago when suddenly I was surrounded by monarchs on our front lawn. And we have always had many passing through at this time of year so I&rsquo;m wondering now if its possible they have roosted in our trees before and we never knew it. We have one acre of fruit trees but beyond that on the other acre, apart from the foot print of our house, we are gradually working our way into native pollinator gardens. In bloom right now, we have a good supply of goldenrod, purple coneflowers, native phlox, rudbeckia, asters are just coming on and Liatris is just finishing. We also have loads of non natives still that we are gradually replacing. In bloom right now are many rose of sharon, one budleia, hydrangeas and lots of scarlet runner beans in bloom. Weather: wind was quite strong and seemed to be coming more from the south than usual. I&rsquo;m not sure of the temp but it was a warm wind. The monarchs were totally sheltered as they were in a stand of trees in the south east corner of our property that grow on either side of our creek. By 11 am on the 1st most of the butterflies had left but then the weather began to change. It got cooler and the wind was now coming from the north west.

So I got out my binoculars and watched til it got too dark to see. Probably about 7:30. I counted up to 50 that I could see with the binoculars by scanning around looking at the several branches they seem to cluster together on.I know there were probably more because I could see some flying into adjacent trees. My house is on a bit of an elevation compared to the surrounding area. It isn&rsquo;t a protected area at all really.

There were 100+ monarchs in the area - too many monarchs to count! They were roosting in nearly every tree in a small grove located in the northwest corner of Maggie Daley park in Chicago, Illinois. I first began seeing multitudes of monarchs flying high above the tall condo buildings in Streeterville/MagMile/River North area the early evening of Wednesday, 09 Sep 2020. It had been raining, yet the monarchs still flew by. On Thursday morning, on my way to work, I saw them again in the same neighborhood. They dissipated from the skies during the day, but again Thursday evening, 10 Sep 2020, they came again - I could see them flying outside my 20th FL office window in Streeterville. It was an incredible sight - one that I had not seen in this neighborhood since the first week or so of September 2017. There were a few stragglers left in the sky on Friday, 11 Sep 2020, but they were mostly gone from the airspace outside my office window. After work, I thought that perhaps I might see a few nectaring at Lurie Garden. On my way, I noticed several monarchs flying above the trees in said corner of Maggie Daley Park, so I walked around to the backside of the trees, and I could not believe my eyes! I'd only seen pictures of such roosts - but never before seen them personally. It was the most spectacular and awe-inspiring sight. 11 Sep 2020 and 12 Sep 2020 were rainy. I returned Saturday, and the roosts were still there. It was raining hard and extremely overcast. I found several other trees throughout the park with large roosts.  The roosts were still there 12 Sep 2020 evening. 13 Sep 2020 was the first sunny, warm, clear day in nearly a week. I went back to the park early between 7-8:45am and the park was alive with monarch butterflies flying around, many basking on the trees, on the pavement, and on the grass. The air was filled with monarchs flying fairly low. I noticed that many monarchs would fly low, and then ""park"" themselves like an airplane on tarmac -- and they were all facing SW. It was uncanny how they were oriented to the same direction. They all parked the same way. I returned the same hour on Monday, 14 Sep 2020, and there was not a single monarch to be seen.  Their complete departure was as striking as their wonderful presence. I'm guessing they may have all departed that sunny Sunday. I would like to note that this year, I saw extremely few monarchs in Chicago during the May-August months were I used to find many.  The first adult monarch I saw was on 24 May 2020 in Lincoln Park. There was no milkweed planted along Upper Wacker. Last year, there was milkweed in the planters, and numerous chrysalises etc. Also, the oval outside Lincoln Park Conservatory was replete with nectaring plants last year. This year, probably due to the pandemic and the mayor leaving parks closed for so long, no flowers had been planted there.

She said there were more butterflies on the 14th than when I was there on the 15th, but she did not attempt to count them.  She also said this was the third consecutive year they have seen a roost in their yard.I observed them from 2:30 to 3:00 p.m. on Sept. 15, then again at about 6:00 p.m. There were fewer butterflies at 6 than there were at 3, which was not what I expected. I tried to count the butterflies in one of the lower clusters (28) and took it times the number of clusters I could see (5).  I rounded up to 200 because the clusters higher in the trees were much larger than the cluster I counted.  There were also lots of butterflies that were resting in other trees, but not gathered in a group.Roughly 75 yards south of where the butterflies were roosting, the homeowners have about an acre of prairie restoration and it was awash in goldenrod.  Overnight low temperature was 57 degrees on the 15th, 55 degrees the night before. There was a light SSW breeze (12 miles an hour) The monarchs were shielded from the wind.

The numbers were down slightly, but still the monarch roost was a magical sight.My husband and I arrived at our estimate by the following:We traversed the entire grove, marveling at the monarchs.We chose one tree, and together we attempted to count the monarchs in each cluster and the number of clusters in that tree.Again, we traversed the entire grove, tree by tree and did the same thing.When we finished, we compared notes with some other observers.

The ground is littered with monarch wings.I basically used the method of counting a visual extended hand circle and then tried to multiply that number times the number of circles I saw. I figured that there were approximately 200 in the trees roosting and another 300 or so in various other nearby trees and nectaring on a couple of seven son flower trees. 500 feels like a pretty conservative number. With all the other monarchs in the air nectaring at different places around the grounds, I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers were over a thousand if not in the thousands. But 500 would be a safe number for a short blip in time in a small 1/8 acre area of our 18 acre Arboretum.To estimate numbers of butterflies preyed upon by the five kites, I counted roughly 120 wings this morning for an estimated 30 butterflies (4 wings/butterfly). Let's take a wild guess that with all the wings collected yesterday and this weekend, that there have been twice that number preyed upon for a total of 60 butterflies.Today (9/23), with calm conditions they are moving on and there were only about 50 roosting and few nectaring this morning. Update at noon - I only counted a dozen...the migrating kites appear to have moved on as well.[Uncertain when roost first formed] I noticed while camping that the south wind picked up to be a bit stiffer on Saturday the 19th which I'm guessing is when the fallout started.

They have roosted on the north side of branches, giving them some protection from the south winds we have had. (Sunday's winds were up to 14 mph out of the south.).  Additionally, our back yard is shielded quite a bit from the wind in general by a wood fence on three sides (east, south, north), the large oak tree, and our home (2+ stories tall).I am not sure where they are feeding.  We have quite a few flowers in our front and back yard, including lantana and coreopsis, which I have read monarchs like, but we haven't seen the monarchs frequent those.  We have also checked out the vacant land on the other side of our hedgerow and looked for milkweed or other food sources but didn't find any.  We do live in a neighborhood with lots of flowers, and there is still some undeveloped land within a fairly short distance of us (about 1/2 mile away) where they might be finding food.

There were also several hundred in fields in the area and trying to find places to rest in trees out of the wind. 70 degrees, 20 mph south wind.  Checked on them at 9 am Saturday (9/26), so they would have been there the Friday night (9/25). They were resting there in the hedge trees (osage orange) because they were protected from the stiff south wind.  The hedge row is a half mile long and there were monarchs all along the hedgerow roosting in the trees. We didn't know how to do an accurate count, so 3000 is just a number to indicate there were countless monarchs. There are at least 300 in one tree.  So if you multiply that by a half mile of trees with monarchs in lots of the trees...  3000 is likely an under-estimate.They were also there Saturday night (9/26) before the cold front came through.  The monarchs seemed to be staging there until the next cold front, numbers were building for several days during severe south winds.  We observed them several times....Saturday morning and evening, and the monarchs were there all day.

First Monarchs seen since last fall's migration.The roost first formed on September 28. We had a huge north wind that hit on the 27th and blew for almost 24 hours. It was the first big north wind this part of South Texas had seen this fall.  The monarchs apparently rode that big wind into my area since I have not seen one in almost a year. Although the number of monarchs fluctuated, I have not seen one in two days. I suspect the reason for that is that we had another big north wind hit two days ago.The number 100 was an estimate. I thought it was a very conservative estimate. The actual number could well have been 200 or more. There were small clusters of monarchs all around the yard at my ranch house.There are no specific nectar sources around the house, but the entire ranch received big rains about the second week of September. It had been quite dry since June prior to those rains.  The ranch is in a semi arid area of Texas. Accordingly, everything grows and blooms after a rain like that. The ranch is about 7 mi.&sup2; in area, and has had no cattle on it since summer due to the drought.  The monarchs were mostly in Live Oak trees when they first appeared. Since then they have also occupied a Hackberry and a Texas persimmon.  The last monarchs to leave seemed to prefer the Texas persimmon.The monarchs were only slightly shielded from the wind where I observed them. They were spread throughout multiple trees.Endnote: For nearly 50 years we had access to another ranch 10 miles north east of Sterling city Texas.  Almost every fall around the first week in November monarchs would suddenly appear.  There were hundreds and hundreds of them clustered in the large trees that grew around a natural spring on that ranch. Water was scarce in the area, and we always assumed it was the spring and big trees that drew them.  In some years there were so many monarchs that the scene reminded us of photos of their winter roost in Mexico, although the butterflies typically only stayed for a day or two.",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2020/10/1526487184.jpg,10034544,100.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

THE MOST WE ALL HAVE SEEN IN A DECADE.THERE IS A CREEK WITH WATER THAT RUNS WITHIN 100 YARDS FROM THE ROOST.  THERE IS SAP FROM APHIDS ON THE LEAVES OF THE TREES.  WITHIN THE LAST 10 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUTTERFLY BUSHES AND FLOWERS PLANTED BUT NO MILKWEED.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE MONARCHS ON THESE PLANTS VERY OFTEN, MOSTLY FEEDING ON THE GRASS AND THE LEAVES OF THE TREES.THE ROOSTING TREES ARE LARGE PECAN TREES, ABOUT 8 OF THEM THAT WERE PLANTED IN THE '60'S ACCORDING TO THE LANDOWNER.   THAT WILL HAVE THE STICKY PECAN APHID SAP ON THE GRASS AND THE TREE LEAVES.THE MONARCHS ARE SHIELDED FROM THE WIND IN THIS LOCATION BY THE HOUSES ON EACH SIDE AND THE LARGE TREES.

They could have come in late the evening prior not entirely sure when exactly.The numbers are a complete estimate.  The first day she didn&rsquo;t look everywhere so they could have grown or could have all been there. They have 20-30 oak trees that they roost in as well as vitex (they love their nectar as well as another plant).  There are also lots of other flowering plants and crepe myrtles.They most prefer the trees on the west side of the house as the house provides a wind block, but honestly they are everywhere.  Their other favorite area is also shielded by a tennis court wind screen.  They originally started coming 15ish years ago to the oak trees on the west side of the house and since then have steady increase in number such that there is honestly no way for me to quantify them.  When my kids run under the trees they fly and swirl around them.  We do not see them fly off for nectar and I suspect they enjoy the plants my parents have.I suspect they return each year as we are on their path and west Texas is generally flat with little vegetation and water.  My dad has planted a forest around his house and I suspect the oasis in the desert is the attractant.See video on Journey North YouTube Channel: <a href=""https://youtu.be/F3pCblf-818"">Midland Texas Monarch Roost</a>",-999999.999,-999999.999,//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2020/10/1526489552.jpg,10034936,10000.0,0,Monarch Fall Roost,0

They were planted in 1975.). I've seen them roosting on and off, but really have just started paying attention. The Pines are the largest trees on island, and only about 4 are left alive. No other trees to speak of except a pear tree, and Bayberry bushes covered in bittersweet vines.This year I pretty much counted most of the individuals [in the roost] and then estimated what I couldn&rsquo;t see clearly on backside of branches.

This year I was only on the island for about 10 days at end of September (24)into October (5). Monarchs were noticeably less plentiful this year as well as fewer other butterflies too.

It was about 12:30 pm and we stayed about a half hour. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t speak to when the roost formed, because we were only their briefly. Roosting is a good description of what I saw though. I had to look twice before I realized they were butterflies, not leaves. Some were flying small distances around the trees, and many were perched on branches. I didn&rsquo;t want to overestimate or exaggerate the number of butterflies so I said 100 as a very conservative estimate. I could easily see there were a couple of dozen in each of the tall oak trees near me. Across the playground there were more trees and I could see butterflies flying in little flocks and settling back into the trees. Honestly, after looking more closely at my pictures and factoring in all the other trees in the park I could see the number being more like 400-500. I&rsquo;m not sure about nectar sources. I didn&rsquo;t notice flowers in the park but there were open fields to the east of the park playground area. The park is on the edge of town in a plains area with grasses, I think some scrub oaks and sage, and some farming and/or ranching. It was a shady area on a hot day, with a little breeze. The trees, playground equipment, and buildings around the park would have offered some shelter from the wind.

A few others about 50. others that I could not see.The roosts were in an area that I had walked through earlier. I walked for about 2 hours between 3:30 and 5:30 and observed the roosts from about 5:30 to sundown about 6:20. The roosts are also only visible from the boardwalk. I am not permitted to walk out into the dunes to look for other sites or to get a different angle. so those views are limited. It's been my experience that the roosts are usually on the east side of trees. I have not noted the wind direction with roosts. I have assumed that they are trying to position themselves to get the morning sun. Some of the areas of goldenrod were big patched while others were more interspersed with dune grasses and other plants. Yesterday the butterflies were widely dispersed. There were a few plants that had several butterflies, but I'd say none had more than 4.For the roosts I just guessed at the number.
