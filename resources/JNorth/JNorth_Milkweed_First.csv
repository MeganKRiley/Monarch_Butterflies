I checked eighty plants in ""my"" swamp milkweed patch in Valley Forge National Park today for eggs and larvae.  Plants averaged between 1 to 8 inches tall.  Last Sunday (April 29)  I checked this same field and did not find any milkweed at all!   On only one plant I found significant first instar damage and found on the same leaf, a tiny caterpillar, way too tiny to identify with a naked eye.  I kept it on the milkweed  and brought it home.  It seemed very similar to  photos of a first instar caterpillar when I looked at it under a magnifying lens  this afternoon.  However, this evening when I went to look at it again, I could not find it.  I would have thought if it were a Monarch caterpillar, it would stay on the milkweed plant.

"" but in Southwest Texas that season isn't as closely related to the advance of the Earth along its orbit, to Springtime on a calendar, as it is to regional weather patterns.  <p>Native plants in hot, dry regions have a different mechanism of response. They feel the warming earth, the longer days, the brighter sun, but they wait, then they wait some more, if need be. Deep in their roots they are holding back: they are a cautious lot! But let there be rainfall; and hey, presto! There are flowers and tiny green leaves, seemingly overnight! Some respond with vigor within three to five days after the least moisture.<p> We see this in our native milkweed, Asclepias oenotheroides (hierba de zizotes), on the banks of the Rio Grande. The year 2002 found us in an almost decade long drought. We began to see monarch butterflies up from Mexico on March 16th, but found no milkweed until 10 days later (3-36-02.) On 3-16-03 we checked the pastures along the Rio Grande for milkweed and found plants 4""-6"" high. <p>In 2004, we found our first milkweed on 3-14 ,when we saw our first monarchs and went out to look for larvae. <p>But all of 2004 was heavily influenced by weather patterns (El Nino) in the Pacific; and we went from a region getting 15""-24"" of rainfall up to a whopping rainfall total just over 50"" in one year! Now keep in mind that Maverick County is just 20 or 30 miles outside the official edge of the Chihuahua Desert, and you can better imagine how startling this is! <p>So when we waded in the mud along the irrigation canal on 2-9-05 we weren't too surprised to fine A. oenotheroides up and growing.  <p>Spring for this region is more determined by the amount of rainfall in October, five months ago, than any other factor, BUT something else is also happening! This past winter we had only 21.1dF for a winter low and fewer than 10 nights of frost, possibly as few as 6 nights below 32dF for a few minutes or hours. One day in January went as high as 85dF.  <p>A neighbor found a Eurasian Collared Dove who had already made a nest and laid an egg!

Astounded, I followed Margarete out to the garden where she showed me three clumps of emerging verticillata and numerous clumps of incarnata with new shoots. I missed them.

The plants in the garden had been above ground at least two days (29th). Too early can be bad and it looks like the early bloom is going to be a disaster this year. Freezing temperatures are predicted for at least three mornings beginning on Wednesday - with temperatures reaching the mid 20s on two of these nights. Those who grow apples and grapes in this area could lose their entire crops.<p>As for the milkweeds, it will be interesting to see if the shoots are killed back to the ground. Even if they are, we should have new grow for the relatively few overwintering monarchs make it this far north. The earliest monarch for me in eastern Kansas was seen on the 7th of April.

One week later - May 4th - some plants have reached 12 inches or more.  We have two other Milkweed varieties in our front garden, Common Milkweed (A. syriaca) and Butterfly Weed (A.tuberosa).  Deer from the nearby Woodland have pretty much eliminated the Common Milkweed, tearing the leaves from the stalks and eating them everytime new growth appears on the plant. [We no longer have access to the Prairie Garden on Campus where Common Milkweed was growing at this time in 2006.  That Garden was far enough away from the Woodland that the Deer left it alone.] The Deer have never fed on the ornamental Milkweeds.  One of these, Butterfly Weed, is slower to sprout initially but should be evident any day now.

I've even seen reports from knowledgeable individuals saying there were monarchs here but no milkweed up and then walked out and found our native milkweeds not only up but some plants up to almost 10+ inches!  I can see how this type of report starts because not all the milkweed comes up at the same time.  Mid-to-late March it is far more scattered and small and more difficult to find, but it IS there.  I've gone to some sites that are covered in milkweed later in April and not found a twig in mid-late March, yet other sites will have sprigs here and there.  <p>If someone is just hitting their favorite site and not finding anything it just means it isn't coming out at that particular site.

She flew over the fence and returned repeatedly.  Somehow, using  her Monarch radar, she managed to find the tiniest shoots of common milkweed -  about two inches high, on which she deposited some eggs.  There are at least a dozen eggs on this pathetic little patch of milkweed. How will these small stalks sustain  the little critters when they hatch? It seems to me the  milkweed is so slow emerging this year but since this is the first year I have anticipated its appearance, I cannot be sure that it is not right on time for this neck of the woods. Could the Monarch be early? I can only hope with sunshine, the latest rains and warmer temperatures, the milkweed demonstrates an enormous growth spurt in time to fee the hungry instars. I was tempted to bring them in and begin my Monarch project  2008, but I have nothing to feed them. So I will just watch and wait to see what Mother Nature has in store.

There has been no precipitation since the beginning of October. We have had sub-zero weather in the morning since the last weeks of October. Temperatures reached -8 C at least 6 times this year making it the coldest winter I can remember in the 11 years I have lived here. Just two weeks ago we had three days that the temperature was at -2C in the morning at 7:00AM. The temperatures have been above 26 C in the afternoon since the beginning of January. We have had temperature swings of as much as 32 degrees C in one day, but the average variation has been about 28 degrees.  <p>All the milkweed plants were hit by the frosts. I have several plants that were under shelter and are blooming. <B>The plants in the garden are just starting to develop leaves at the base of the stems</B>. I have not seen any new plants coming up from seed yet. <p>We lost many plants this year as the first frosts arrived earlier than expected. Bougainvillea that was not covered had to be cut all the way back. We still don't know if it survived. We lost about 10 young trees, (avocado, mandarin, lime, lemon, jacaranda and some young pines). Many succulent plants died also this year. the good news is that we planted a magnolia tree and it survived beautifully! It is only one meter tall and its first fragrant flower has just opened.  <p>Nectar sources are available for butterflies. Apple, peach and plum trees are in full bloom. Since the afternoons have been fairly warm all winter, there are actually a few small apples on the trees already. The organ cacti are full of flowers and hummingbirds are already arriving to feed on them early in the morning. <p>Plants that are starting to emerge are Mexican hat, sweet alyssum and plumbago. <p>We haven`t seen any monarchs yet, but they could be coming by any day now. There are two native plants that are usually in bloom in both the spring and the fall when they migrate.

We had a warming trend two weeks ago with temps in the high 70'sF but then for the past week the temps have dipped back into the 50's F during the day with up to 30 mph winds, which made it feel a lot colder and low 30's F at night with strong winds that gave a wind chill reading of mid 20's F. Not much else showing signs of life except for the forsythias that have begun to flower in the past 3 days and the tulips which are just beginning to show buds.  It is extremely dry outside though and incredibly windy, which is creating a risk of forest fires.  Just yesterday I stopped by the roadside and attempted to put out a patch of burning grass and mulch as it got out of hand from a tossed cigarette and ironically the town fire chief pulled in behind me and called for a firetruck over his radio to put it out.  Hopefully we get some rain and the spring growing season can continue.",-999999.999,-999999.999,https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2014/1398433230.jpg,9922543,-999999.999,1,Milkweed (FIRST Leaves),1

I have recently read an article sent to me by a friend which states that Asclepia curravasica, which is what all of my milkweed is, is possibly not good for the monarchs. It apparently makes them weak so that they cannot complete their migration to Mexico.  It apparently has to do with a tropical milkweed by that name that ""winters over"" in south Texas, never dies back.  I am assuming that since mine dies back to the ground and sprouts new stems and leaves each year that it does not cause this malady.

I've been doing the development of the Monarch Butterfly since 1999 with school kids and children in my neighborhood, Mothers, Dads, Grandparents; anyone who is interested. Children stay around for awhile having fun with the little caterpillars and then they go off to play. Adults they stick around a little longer, observing and asking questions and always coming back to look for eggs on the milkweed. Later it's maybe to have a glimpse of a chrysalis under a leaf or even to watch the beautiful Monarchs laying on Milkweed flowers!...and even though in the last few years their have been far and few Monarchs passing through our Prairie Provinces, yes we are always so very hopeful of their return to our land here in Manitoba and we look forward to their wonderful sight during our ever so short summer days. We are so happy when we first see them here and glad to welcome their wonderful and colorful presence in this incredible journey back to North America and even so to our Beautiful country of Canada!

I first started by ordering caterpillars through the mail, as well as tropical milkweed plants. After some research I started growing my own milkweed. I now grow tropical, swamp and common milkweed. My garden area is small put it holds plenty of milkweed. I soon had my first monarchs flying in and from there-eggs. I placed the leaves with eggs in containers until the caterpillars hatched then I put them in a small fish tank-feeding them daily until they formed chrysalis. Over the years I have released approximately 20 monarchs a year. Last year, unfortunately, I saw few monarchs and no eggs. However my sister in New Jersey raised over 20 Monarchs ( I introduced her to monarch raising!). So I am hoping they will be back in my area this summer.

In the past I&rsquo;ve looked in mid Feburary 10-15th and not found any MW, so it is still very early in Austin. The highway dept. mowed this area over the winter and seem to have timed it pretty good for wild-flowers.  ( I was out late November and the grass was so high few flowers could compete but I did find a couple fall Milkweed).Bluebonnets range from tiny four leaved rosettes to small bloomers.  Its really early for them and strange they vary so much in size.February in Austin was the hottest on record, but we had a couple really nice cold snaps in January and regular moisture all winter when the wildflowers germinate, so all in all we should be in good condition for the returnees with both nectar and host plants.Courtesy of Monarch Watch",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,0,-999999.999,1,Milkweed (FIRST sighted),0

My showy and narrow leaf plants are only 1-3 inches tall right now. They are not ready to feed caterpillars until the fall migration, where we typically see mama Monarchs ovipositing beginning in late July or early August. I’ve heard there is fear that planting milkweed along the coast would create overwintering resident Monarch populations and so it should be avoided. However, in my humble opinion, this is not possible. For one thing, there would be no larval food for spring or early summer cats. Plus, it snows at sea level in Humboldt County (we had 6 inches in January) so our winters are just too cold. ",-999999.999,-999999.999,-999999.999,9987350,-999999.999,1,Milkweed (FIRST sighted),0
